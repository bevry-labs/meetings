# Discussion on morality

### @John

Can't have a morality necessarily based in science because we're seeking Oughts instead of ISes. To get an ought requires placing in an a priori highest value.

Is morality objectively based or subjectively based?

is it/should it be biologically determined?

Aristotle: Lasting happiness, eudimonia, telos

Nietzsche: that which heightens the will to power

Kant: absolute moral laws (not about consequences)

Piaget:

Aquinus: natural law (built off intuition, perhaps like Buddha)

Harris: well-being.

Molyneaux: Whatever it is that is prefferable to its antithesis. Volunteered behaviors do not apply. (somewhat kantian)

Jesus: Responsibility.

Marx: fulfillment of the individual (in desire)

Spinoza:

Jainism: (pacificism, non-agression)

Benetar:

Rawls: rights and freedoms (inequalities are allowed as long as it brings the lowest person better off because of it)

Evolutionary: Whatever system is in place that allows for exploiters proves the fault of the system.

Reinforced subjective:Based off of positive feedback, and avoiding negative feedbak, (includes empathetic positive reinforecement)

Relativism: (tastes)

Utilitarianism.

Moralities based off of 'thou shalt not's and only rights.

Science and arts.

Logos and eros.

When does morality become 'objective'? what age? Does it slowly develop?

Is morality absolute?

There can always a better progression. from where you are currently, any system that dissallows growth is 'bad.' (well what if you've hit perfection?)

if two people desire something and both consent... Haidt's example of intuitary morality.

Problems with libertarian morality is when people interact with each other.

(owning a consensual slave)

Good and evil.

What is evil?

The fulfillment of needs.

Topics to go over within frame

1. homosexuality

2. Capital punishment

3. Abortion

4. Contraception

5. AI

6. Torture

7. War

8. Collateral damage

9. Social needs of frail

10. Guns

11. Foreign affairs

Necessity of empathy, dualism between sides (Opposites coexisting), moral taste buds

Liberty/Oppression

Sanctity/degradation

**Authority/Subversion**

**Loyalty/Betrayal**

**Fairness/Cheating**

**Care/Harm**

**Problem of a limited god of law or individual, **

Fulfilling the responsibilities of previous action. And lineage

Morality built off of gene spreading, firstly towards your genetic lineage, then self and spouse (being raisers of said lineage), then your shared gene-holders (siblings, family), then community, then society, then world.

The value may change depending upon the threat of potential extinction within one layer that will affect the inner layer.

Admiration of character based upon how successful the imitation of that character would relate to gene spreading into the future. Even if those admirable characters were actually accidents, their consequences teach us what will occur if we did the same.

The evolution psychologically of the Christ figure within us.

Conscience not merely within our head but within our spouses and other people we interact with.

The discovery, and ability to discover, the best goods. Non-absolute, somewhat relative since admirability depend upon the system in place to allow that.

Conscience, religion, and psychology.

Purpose for morality/ethics

Group selection.

Unconscious intuitions of evolution.

Morality based off of historical admirable characters of a society and their consequences.

Swear words as indicators of moral tastebuds for the culture

Moral responsibility (galileo/jesus) 

Hopefully wherever we end up won't take us to Nazi Germany.

* Don't set up a goal for yourself that is too big that you are crushed by it. Have humble beginnings.

    * You are gonna get slapped - so take responsibility.

    * Listen to the people who slap you.

## @John

13:00,  to fortify your faith in life and Being, isn't to try to convince yourself to believe in some higher power, as you would in believing facts. It's something to be believed through action.

17:00, in the brothers karamazov (and in life) the arguments are not the point. it's how you conduct yourself in action within the world

24:00, God did temp tabraham, which is a funny thing for god to do (Gen, 22:1 Look up  place in new testament

50:00, it's as if there is someone watching you in the sky, and smiles upon you when you make sacrifices (reinforced behavior)

53:00, if the world you are seeing is not the world that you want, it's time to examine your values. and give them up

1:00:00, the images of abraham and isaac are dualistic in nature of that story as well and God and Jesus

Set up a goal in your life and run the goal to its end. You will need to re-orient yourself after that and come up with a new goal.

* Shed what is no longer necessary. Fire in the forest metaphor.

## @John

1:40, a sacrifice is necessary in order to progress to the next epoch of your life

20:30, it's a greater sacrifice to give up something that is a part of you than somethi

1:48:00, (i'm not satisfied with the 'post-shadowing' excuse for that consequence.) [ Bible.org :   "That's what happened to Lot. He allowed little sins in his life to go unchecked. They weren’t ng you own.

23:50, Modern man is unable to take things seriously (like resolutions) because they no longer perform symbolic acts

26:30, women aren't as much in need of such symbolic acts as their own biology already act as these transformations of character (menstruation, loss of virginity, childbirth)

45:00 you can make your ideal judge incrementally, that tells you what you can let go of in order to become

56:00, human rights are predicated upon the christian idea that all humans have an intrinsic divine element

58:50, bread that is not bread is information (word that comes of god)

1:06:00, if you really want something you will sacrifice everything to get it.

1:16:00, there is potential waiting to burst forth from the material (gardening, telos)

1:28:00, that's what people can do. and you're one of them.

1:48:00, (i'm not satisfied with the 'post-shadowing' excuse for that consequence.) [ Bible.org :   "That's what happened to Lot. He allowed little sins in his life to go unchecked. They weren’t major, shocking kinds of sins--just “little" sins. But they were steadily eroding his moral character, until finally the sordid incident recorded here burst the dam.” ---- “Lot’s daughters were frustrated because, due to their father’s passivity and sin, they found themselves sitting in a cave with no prospects for marriage in sight. So they decided on this shameful method of having children. If you are a passive father, just letting your own and your family’s spiritual life drift, you are creating frustration in them that is likely to result in them taking charge of the situation and moving in the wrong direction.” Electra complex, perhaps the feeling of the daughters to make up for the loss of their mother.

1:59:00, (for a young person wanting to earn the right to know these great books, they must incorporate them into their own personal lives.)

(-youtube comment on homosexuality to possibly discuss)

Patrick Thomas:

I have to think that Dr. Peterson is going out of his way not to piss off the Gay community here.  Because this constant re-emphasis that the story has nothing to do homosexuality I think is wishful thinking and not missing the physiological significance of sexual immorality running rampant in a culture leading to even worse sin, such as the other things that Dr. Peterson suggest like impulsive conduct. 

The story as far as I can see includes the idea of acts of homosexuality being part of the immorality within the society that has become fully perverse.  That homosexuality being an accepted part of the society is therefore significant.  Now it is only part of the whole of the problem of Sodom and Gomorrah.  The other parts of mistreating strangers and the conduct of the culture as a whole is the full reason that Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed. 

Much of the bible is making the case giving into your basic desires without regard to moral principle lead to self destruction.  If those bad characteristics become common place in a society than the society will self destruct.  Homosexuality as the bible views it is an example of giving into basic desires without regard to moral principle and that is why it is a sin. 

Now homosexuality is not the only form of perversion in this story or within the bible but to suggest it has nothing to do with the point of the story I can't see as being intellectual honest.﻿

1.02.00, there are such things as redemptive mistakes. (That by doing making us less dumb)

1.21.00, maintain your faith in the good and continue to move forward.

1.25.00, there are social strictures, that even if the ruler of the land transgresses against them, there will be hell to pay.

1.28.00, what is it i should do that is worth sacrificing my life to?

1.30.00, (peterson puts way more emphasis on these stories by analyzing them as a coherent story that was intentionally written, than I or my family had done by reading the bible every day)

**Nature of the reality and Body you inhabit - It's always corrupt and insufficient.**

* Gratitude

    * You should be grateful that the structure you inhabit is not a absolute complete mess.

* What's the meaning of life - what you should do in life ?

    * Try to improve and fix the structure no matter where you are. Start with highest resolution (locally first). Yourself -> Family -> Community -> State.

    * Confronting the chaos and improving the structure that you inhabit. At least it gives you something to do.

        * << That what progressives are trying to do - don't you think ? >>

        * << I remember a my friend in India told me how in west there isn't much to do since basic infrastructure is already there and seem to work while in India there is so much to improve - so many basic problems. >>

        * Why do I want to waste time improving trivial things ? I want to do big things.

            * JBP's argument is that "anything done right" is not trivial at all and it pays of in ways that you can’t think right now.

        * **I don't have much power - influence how can I improve things ?**

            * You weakness is a necessary ingredient in your heroism. Fragility is build into courage.

                * If you knew all the answers and were invincible - then what's so heroic about that.

    * Meaning at workplace - the idea that certain kind of jobs are trivial and don't have much meaning e.g. Waiter

        * You can either turn the job into absolute misery for yourself and other people or you can act out in a civilized manner regardless of the job.

            * No matter where you are there is richness and complexity. Maybe I didn't expect to be a waiter but it’s not nothing.

                * Treat your customers and colleagues properly.

                * Prepare for better opportunity if it comes along.

            * **Exercise 7.1: **In your day job, try to figure out one thing you can do or something you can change about yourself that will make everyone's life (yours/co-workers/customers) better. Then start doing that thing.

* What will lead to satisfaction in life ?

    * Upward Trajectory - headed somewhere better than you are right now.

        * And realization that it has something to do with your direct action.

        * **Exercise 7.2: **Pick an area of your life and analyze it with the goal of figuring out whether you are on upward or downward trajectory.

            * If on upward trajectory - figure out if it's an accident or can be traced back to your actions.

                * If it's an accident you gotta ask yourself one questions ["Do I feel lucky ?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7Nci-GVuHE) If yes for how long you think will be lucky punk ?

                * If it's because of something you are doing, you are not a punk and keep doing it. Maybe even do it better over time.

    * In life you have got a choice b/w two paths.

        * Taking responsibility or being bitter/resentful.

            * What makes you think where you are is not as good as a place to start as any ?

        * CJ - modern people won't see God because they don’t look low enough.

            * << WTH is this supposed to mean ? >>

* **What you are made of is what you become when you voluntarily encounter the unknown.**

    * << Interesting idea, I have always thought you can tell a lot about a man based upon the society/culture he inhabits. Because the direction in which you grow is a response to that structure that you inhabit. If you create safe-spaces where people are shielded from what they don't want to hear then you are just creating a generation of pussies. They will not get to exercise their mental muscles to deal with chaos which is a terrible thing to happen to a person because these days the job market changes so fast - you are always on your toes trying to acquire new skill (at least that’s the way it is happening in tech sector). How are you going to deal with all that ? >>

    * **Aim is so that if you can become the kind of person who repairs the city and not just the repair. It's about transforming yourself.**

    * **Desire to make things worse and avoid responsibility.**

        * << He didn't give much details on that. Is there some other lecture where he talks about it ? I would love to know more about a human having a desire to make his own life a living hell. >>

    * Incremental progress. If you make 0.01 % improvement in your life then over time it will build up.

* Why does the city fall apart ?

    * Entropy.

    * Deception/Corruption.

    * How to identify what's true ?

        * << He doesn't answer that question in this lecture. >>

        * **He just says you know what the truth is based upon the game you have decided to play.**

            * **So, stop cheating on whatever game that you have decided to play.**

    * Satanic arrogance that you can lie/deceive - twist/bend the structure of reality and get away it with.

    * Destroy order and let the chaos rise back up.

        * << Sounds very similar to what progressives are doing with their contempt of pillars of western civilization. >>

    * Aiming up vs Aiming down.

        * If you aim down enough and if enough of you aim down - things will become so chaotic as it was in beginning of time.

        * Taking from the corpse of you father - without any gratitude and without replenishing anything.

            * << Where does this corpse of father come from ? >> (@john: early mesopotamian mythology)

            * Don't do it for long enough because things will happen that are so bad you can’t distinguish them from hell.

    * Cain destroying the ideal.

        * My punishment is more than I can bear.

            * Where are you once you destroy your own ideal ?

            * **[Milton's Paradise Los**t](https://archive.org/details/miltonsparadiselmilton)** **- Hell to the extent that you are distant from good.

            * Pulling down people whom you look up to.

            * He does it voluntarily.

            * God decides to wipe the whole thing to the ground.

            * **Cain vs Abel as a struggle b/w short term and long term activities.**

    * What led to the downfall of societies ?

        * The downfall of the individuals who inhabit it - there were not just following orders.

            * Fear of punishment does not completely explain it.

        * People each and everyone decided to lie and turn blind eye to what was happening.

            * << This is unbelievable, just unbelievable. >>

        * **Your moral degeneration contributes in no small way to the degeneration of entire cosmos.**

            * Ripples of our actions have consequences that are far beyond our immediate perception.

            * People knowing things at deep emotional level. They can feel them.

                * But they don't let those things become articulate. They don’t want to know.

            * Feeling guilty because of things you have done or not done.

                * **There is a part of you that is aiming at the worst things.**

                    * CJ - Shadow of a human reaches all the way down to the hell.

                * There is a part of cosmos also that want worse things to happen.	

                    * << That's what I was waiting for. Now even the cosmos is out to get you man. WTH ! >>

                * << Why do people keep meaning and realization at an arm's length ? >>

            * Recognizing yourself as a Nazi Prison Guard.

            * **Exercise 7.3: **Thought Experiment: Imagine yourself as a Nazi prison guard and try to do despicable things that they did in your imagination. Is there any way - pressure/motivation under which you would do something like that ?

                * << I believe mental circuits for this can be very similar to circuits for addiction. Once you start to enjoy torturing others and drive certain amount of pleasure from it - you just keep going looking for that high again. You become more and more vicious but the high eludes you. >>

                * JBP did a similar experiment. He thought he was a good guy till that point in time.

                    * Respect for yourself because you understand the monstrous side of your psyche.

                    * Regarding yourself as a loaded weapon esp around children.

            * His psyche split into two around this point - doer and observer.

                * Observer will just observe and make comments on his behaviour.

                * Which of these two things is me ?

                * If you say things that are as truthful as they can be - they come from the core of your being or at least somewhere more near it.

                    * He had to stop saying anything at all. You are mostly dead wood.

                        * Realization that you lie a lot.

                    * << That's the feeling I got while listening to Steve Jobs - he seemed to speak from a pretty deep place. >>

            * **Exercise 7.4: Try to observe what you are saying and try to be as true as you can be. Try to speak from the core of your being.**

                * **[Carl Roger**s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers) work on this.

            * **If you have nothing much to do and if you are not pushing yourself to your boundaries then you have plenty of resources left to causing trouble.**

            * **Hatred and resentment are very attractive emotions.**

            * **Exercise 7.5:** List down examples from the past where you were hell bent on your own destruction and failure.

        * **Exercise 7.6: ****Awareness -** Think how your moral failures are contributing to larger problems in your environment. What kind of impact you are having on those around you ?

            * Note that you could be hurting others by being nice to them on the surface - by not telling the truth (because of fear of offending them) you deprive them of critical feedback that they need to improve themselves.

            * You don't wake up on time, work hard, waste your time - hence never write that book/never makes that music etc…

            * You might be causing harm just by not bringing the best version of yourself into existence - the one who would have inspired so many other to improve themselves otherwise.

    * Humans are the only creatures that are willfully malevolent and deceitful. This can get so bad that it take imagination of a very bad person to describe them.

        * Gods repented their creation so much that they decided to wipe it out.

* Noah's story

    * Noah is perfect and he walked with God.

        * << What does walking with God mean ? >>

    * What to do when things are going bad ?

        * How to build an arch and go through it or ride it out ?

        * Do something that you consider worthwhile.

    * What is the mode of being the protects you ?

    * NRA ad shocked JBP.

        * Women with contempt on her face with images of antifa rioters in the background.

        * Get your guns to fight back against hollywood and corrupt intellectuals.

        * **<< If anyone can find the URL for that add please add it here. >>**

        * **We are in a political situation where every act of individual foolishness will move us close to the end.**

    * **Sermon on the Mount**There is so much different b/w the archetype and you that it feels distance. It needs to be defined in various aspects so that you can strive for it and try to implement it.

        * Aim for the highest possible good and strive to achieve it. Your daily needs will work it out. Leap of faith.

        * Ant vs the Grasshopper.

        * **Ex****ercise 7.7:** Introspect: What is the highest good that you can achieve ?

        * **Exercise 7.8:** Introspect: When in a difficult situation, ask yourself is there anything you did in last 6 months that contributed to this ?

            * Taking the beam out of your eyes first.

        * You don't try - you don’t say here is what I would like to have I can have it ?

        * **Exercise 7.9:** Looks at yourself as another person - someone you care about. Then ask yourself - what would the better life for this person look like ?

            * 3 years from now you can have what you need if you figure it out and aim at it. If you aim you will get it.

            * As you take steps towards what you want - you might update it if it's not correct.

            * **The chances of random success is zero.**

        * Faith makes being good - if you act properly in the world being will reveal itself as good.

    * Golden rule is misunderstood somewhat - **Conceptual how great things can be for you then work to make them true for everyone.**

        * Budhha was tempted with the offer to stay in nirvana forever he reject the offer and came back to help more people attain that.

    * Very narrow path if you are doing things right - the path to hell is very wide.

    * Entering heaven - christianity 

    * **Judgement day - everyday is judgement day."And then will I profess unto the, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."**

        * Your own ideal sits in the judgement of your own iniquity.

        * Without ideal you have got no meaning in life - the more perfect the ideal the harsher the judgement.

        * Dispenses with the ideal because you don't want to be judgement.

    * Christ taught people with authority as opposed to just saying stuff because it sounded good.

## @John

16, Anything done right is not trivial, will pay off. Net consequence over time was good.

17, Fragility is built into courage. Transform yourself into becoming the on capable of transforming the city.

48, He (Peterson) separated into 2 being, one that was a critic.

1:16, What stupid thing am I doing on a regular basis that is hurting me in the long run.

1:24, Watch yourself to 2 weeks and keep track of how often and when everything is arrayed properly, then use that info to try to recur those scenarios.

1:44, These stories can be taken concretely so as to be understood by every type of person, but it's incorrect to read them as a child would if you're an adult... (paraphrased)

                * Bad things happening to you when you don't know why or what to make of them ?

    * **Where are you going ?**

        * **Exercise: Nobody ever sits down and say justify your existence.**

            * Defend you plan - why do you think it's not the plan of a fool ?

            * What's good about you and what needs some work ?

        * Carl Jung - Story

            * Someone else's story - you only get to live a bit then.

            * Story you don't know. You might be living a malevolent tragedy.

                * Bad ending or even worse ending.

        * Why keep yourself in the fog ?

            * Once you decide where you want to go:

                * You have to work hard to get there.

                * You know when you are not on track and you need to change your behaviour or the plan. Former is painful.

        * What happens if you don't know where you are going ?

            * You biology will come up with a plan for yourself.

        * **How do you define a goal ?**

            * Don't have vague goals because then differentiation b/w tools/obstacles/irrelevant is not that clear. 

        * Once you decide a goal all the objects you encounter belong to 3 categories.

            * Tools - that can help you achieve the goal.

            * Obstacles - Things that get in your way.

        * Why aim for the highest goal possible ?

            * Because it's worth it and alternative is meaningless suffering.

            * Make something of yourself that so that all this suffering is worth it.

            * **Exercise: Come up with your goals for next 3 to 5 years.**

                * If you pick up a high number like 10 years - then there are too many variables and things that can change.

    * **How to navigate ?**

        * Helping someone - specify the thing you want them to do at highest resolution possible.

            * Telling a child to clean up the room is not enough you need to tell him/her how to do it ? e.g.

                * Pick up this teddy and put in cupboard.

                        * Catastrophic demise of you current paradise to build a new one.

                    * What if you got exactly what you were aiming for in the sense that maybe some part of you was aiming for failure and self-destruction.

                        * **Exercise: Find out part of you that aims for worst things and clean them up.**

                * **How to avoid catastrophic failures  and descent into complete chaos ?**

                    * **Exercise: Be aware and notice things. When things go even little bit wrong fix them.**

                        * Have thousand micro-deaths and recover from them rather than waiting for complete catastrophic failure from which you may never recover.

    * **Story of Noah - Giants of the earth**

        * Human knowledge builds up over time by the small contributions of many. Hero or the Giant is the amalgam of all these many people across history. 

        * Prevalent of flood stories across many different cultures/parts of the world.

        * What's the cause of these floods (in a psychological sense and not literally) ?

            * Sins of man and decrepitude of the world.

                * Sins of commission

                    * People doing things that they know to be wrong.

                * Sin of omission

                    * Failure to do things that they know to be right.

            * **A mysterious being will wipe you out if you continue to act on your wayward ways.**

                * **Exercise**

                    * **Find out things you know are wrong but you still do them. Try to stop.**

                    * **Find out things you know are right but you don't do them. Try to do them more often.**

                    * Mesopotamians would do this exercise where they will take the emperor at New Year and ask him what mistakes he made.

                * **Exercise Try to predict what measure flood in your life could wipe you out.**

                    * Start preparing to avoid it or to ride it out. Put yourself together.

    * **How to sort out your relationship ?**

        * Sort out your interactions.

            * E.g. When you come home that's like 5 minutes interaction. Discuss with them and make it better.

            * The more interactions you sort out the better.

        * Start maintaining them when your start noticing emotional distance. Don't wait for things to get worse.

        * When you live with someone else you don't know what to expect and what they want ?

            * Make a list of things that needs to be done and negotiated who should do what.

    * **Time Management**

        * You come up with a plan when you brain is fully working - when you are tired you don't have to plan just execute low priority tasks.

    * **Other**

        * Difficult to live with someone and love them at the same time.

19,  if nature selects you to be adapted to be able to deal with chaos and order, thats a good implication that the world is made out of chaos and order. (We also are capable of experiencing spiritual event, not even always through psychedelics.)

29, Tzadik, the messianic figure that returns willingly to state he lost from childhood, while still being conscious. (Read through this) (rosebud)

32, Adler: life lie, Rogers: dialogue, truth shall set you free.

37, the reason Elohim is pluralistic is because he's a multitude of 'gods' all as one. (Original, and simplistic, conception was it was father and son, but that doesn't reason why Jews have Elohim)

39, we'll try to get through all five books during these 12 lectures. (Ha ha ha)

41, a sacrifice is a bargain with the future. (He also said, act in the way that makes your future self proud, or something. My new reliance upon my past self, neuhmanns realization that animal sacrifices actually work) u9

53, tend the garden (means to take care of the earth, seems silly that I hadn't known this, maybe I had just don't think about it enough)

54, snake with human head (is our spine, our base structure)

55, look like magic mushrooms (The stoned ape theory, back to earlier point on nature selecting)

56, Sabbath, you hav to take a rest so as not to burn out. (back to earlier point on sacrifice) (The office, Michael's justification for movie Monday is they work faster... in order to get all their work done.) (Eureka moment)

1:01, not mere metaphors, why else bother with abstraction? Eating raises spirits, neuhmann.

1:05, information foragers, like squirrels, meta food, information where the food is, more valuable. Information is the highest value (doesn't contradict his idea of truth, because it's more valuable, so truth is information with the highest value, not the scientific method)

1:07, meta-trees (trees in the bible are most often analogous to man, like trees walking etc, so if this analogy is using the same symbol there might be a correlation, our ability to feed off of the information from each other, this is my body and my blood, to gain knowledge. that then forces us to survive off of our own amount of limited knowledge, as well as giving birth to bowling ball heads) (the birds have no worry for the future, goes back to the childlike bliss we long to return to of giving up oneself to the higher authority)

1:08, the four rivers, the holy city, the self. Strange intermingling (intersection) of geography. (The 4 corners, the overlapping intersections, the cross) (also, as for these geographical locations, there is a literal meaning inside of every Hebrew name, and these could be used for higher understanding of the analogy) (eden could/should be my basis for the script) (look up names)

1:10, why tell them not to eat of it? (if God is the future, he said not to eat of the tree, then later, Adam and eve both realized their mistake and regretted it, becoming like God, the fruit is knowledge of future potential of actions) (good sci fi script) (God is our conscience that knows the future)

1:14, John wheeler, the photon would not leave it's source unless it has an endpoint.

1:39, women buy these magazines and attracted to them and enjoy them. (The feminists are rejecting the internal patriarchy that women are willing to go along with, thus taking away the individuals free will, free expression of their own femininity, trying to turn them into something else... A man. A weak man. A comrade. A tyrannical coward.)

1:52, women may have evolved for the mother-child relationship (this is a good jumping off point for my theory on God, mankind may have evolved in order to best benefit the entire group, the culture, we have developed the ability to speak and share thoughts between us into a way that is monumental, evolutionarily shifting, something new in the entire known universe of time and space.)

1:55, we're very dependant (as with the model T, we're more efficient the more segmented we are. We're even more efficient when we share a common goal in our individuality, that's the future, more capability, making things easier, that's God.)

1:57, metaphysical blindness (scales from eyes, the past suddenly changing as peterson says, scales from the eyes, the cosmic awareness from psychedelics that leads to higher creativity)

1:58, we became aware that we are vulnerable. (That's that awareness of the potential future) (this is what separates us from animals, they exist in their own naivety, unaware of what is either good or bad, they just 'is.' Organism is projecting our own conception of morality onto the lives of those with no need or use for good or evil. We can avoid eating them for our own comfort and attempting to become less monstrous, but do not pretend you're doing it for the animal's benefit, that is virtue signaling to an animal that is unable to recognize your generosity. In the animal kingdom the predators keep the prey from overpopulating and ruining the environment for the prey. To exist is better than to not. Even in extreme suffering, but I'm not sure that animals are aware of the concept of suffering, only living, and not living, and to not live is bad, but in reality to live forever is bad too, for the environment were currently on would not allow it. Maybe once we have more planets to experiment with. Still, let's not ruin the one we're on currently.) (Also, we don't eat chimps, rats, or cats or dogs,  because they express aspects of our own personality that we enjoy/learn from, the other animals have evolved in order to serve the higher power (us, in their case) much like a banana has been evolved to be more useful for us, cows have been adapted to exist for a purpose, to be tasty and  eaten, like aphids, to essentially be used and useful once they die, and they are going to always die, so why not give them a retroactive reason for why they existed in the first place. (Adapt this into a Socratic argument) )

2:05, snakes ARE lizards that lost their legs, just so you know. (There are aspects of literal truth inside this text, truth not able to be known from an individual at that time, but a collection of knowledge and understanding from before we even had speech, this is important. There's truths within us not from ourselves but from all of time, able to recognize patterns without our own recognition while we sleep, and predict the future from our past ancestors. And then we can utilize this past knowledge to change the potential future from occurring the way we were told it would occur (jonah) this is the third time I've listened to this, these are all new truths I hadn't gotten before) (same with larger developed brains bringing pain in childbirth

2:09, I'll go over this all next week. (That's the sprouting of plants, the rebirthing figure that grows, is cut down and comes again. That's evolution, that's farming, that's us. That image also looks like the Djed, the symbol of osiris, the same figure as Christ, that's the base of the spine that is planted and becomes the headpiece.)

2:12, unit 731 did this to investigate frostbite. (They had a justification for their inhuman acts, that justification was the seeking out of knowledge as foremost, no sympathy for their fellow man and our existence. That's how a Brave New World happens, dissolution of the fact that man as a divine creature, that is aware of suffering, that dissolution gives justification to people like Eric Harris or Joseph Stalin or Adolph Hitler.)

2:14, that's the enemy. (Ha'satan, the Hebrew word for the devil just means adversary) (Satan is within all of us, even Peter, Jesus's disciple)

(My favorite of all his lectures)

2:23, cosmic serpent, breaking open the head. (I need to read these books. My own education has failed me. I am seeking to recompense this by quitting my day job, moving out of my father's house, living in poverty off of money I can make by minimally working as an Uber driver. During this time I will be devoting my life to reading (more potential via the balto app), writing, and seeking a foothold at the base of the ladder for the career I feel is most important for my own self.)

2:24, there's no way we could have known what DNA looked like before we did. There's more to spirituality than materialism, we know things in our future somehow, not just through psychological guiding towards that future, but unknown truths that are shown to us from something more than our own current system, there's another book, I haven't read yet, but am eager to by the title: They Knew the Unknown, which may go into the muse of Socrates and Tesla, etc.)

2:27, recognizing their own shadow. (Rogan mentions this when he sparks with women in Jiu Jitsu, he knows what he could do that would instantly pin them, or worse, damage them to be paralysed, that understanding of evil he could inflict also includes the existence of hood, to know those evils we can do and to avoid them, but if we do not know what is evil we could accidently murder someone, then not see our mistake and do this again and again, moral law is evolutionary in a way, at least in regards to the avoidance of inflicting suffering. But suffering is also beneficial for us because it causes us to become better than who we are, hmm, but that suffering upon us we attribute to Satan, the devil, pure evil, and will view the person inflicting suffering upon us as that person. That's why God is the great and terrible father, he is so much more powerful than us that we have to accept him in all aspects, even allowing Job to be  tortured.)

2:29, God gave us Satan to make us substantial. (What a fantastic vision to receive) (The dragon protects us from the treasure)

## @srai

For the books he talks about I have added goodreads links but please note that I don't endorse goodreads even though I have an accout there and update my reading progress regularly and I’m a fool to trust them with my private book notes (you don’t have to either).

* 0:48 - Finished my latest book.

* 1:20 - Been thinking for a long time still can't fathom how can there be so much information in these stories.

    * <<  Hahahah. Professor there are people out there how read these stories and go "God, Apple, Snakes, Garden bla bla bla, whatever". What I am cusrious about is what is it about you that makes you see so much information in these stories when so many people can't ? >>

* 1:40 - Layer after layer more information comes out.

* 2:08 - These stories contain information that we generated interpersonally over a very long period of time and modified over time by the process of transmitting/remembering - transmitting/remembering over vast stretches of time.

* 2:33 - Will take that apart today.

* 2:52 - Cane and Abel story - personal/familial/political/warfare/economics. Lot for a one paragraph story to cover.

    * << All the things we love talking about >>

* 3:11 - Postmodern idea - you never know what you are reading here. How do you know your interpretation of the world is sufficient (not correct) ?

* 3:28 - It is correct if you act it out and other people don't object too much and you don’t die and nature doesn’t take a bite out of you any more often than necessary (functionally successfully).

    * << Obvious question: What about Gandhi/Gallio/Luthor or other people who die protesting in fascist regimes (death is certain if you do that but they still do it) ? >>

* 4:03 - Chances that you can come up with an interpretation by chance that will work at multiple levels is decreasing (multimethod/multitrait - more ways you can measure it the more certain you can be that you are not deluding yourself with you a priori hypothesis.

    * << Same way with life - when multiple things/failures direct you to develop a particular skill. >>

* 4:55 - Try not to teach people something that is not personally relevant. When you are being taught something you should know what the fact is good for. Good for you, good for your family and maybe good for the society.

    * << Right on, makes me think of my school days where you are just supposed to learn things without anyone telling you why >>

* 4:58 - No utility in teaching facts that are not meaningful.

    * << How about the uninitialized ones ? >>

* 5:11 - Facts should serve as tools for us. We are tool using characters.

* 5:40 - Stories are so foundational that everybody share them (same for many fairy tales at** least recently**).

* 6:05 - You have to at least treat them as remarkable curiosities. Why them ? Why they stuck around for so long ?

* 6:21 - Freud's explanation: Familial father was expanded up in cosmic dimension so that mankind existing in the same relationship with cosmic father say that an infant or small child existed in relationship his/her own father.

* 7:57 - People who act out the role of religious followers act out the role of dependent children. Becker missed the point in same way that Freud missed Jung's point.

    * << [The Denial of Death by  Ernest Becker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2761.The_Denial_of_Death) (flawed but great book). >>

* 8:18 - Creating God is nothing but we trying to create quasi infantile state of dependency and to be able to rely upon all knowing father. Recover the comfort we had when we were younger and had all knowing father (or those of us who were lucky to have someone vaguely like that).

* 8:33 - Charles Taylor wrote an interesting book called the "Origins of the Modern Self" - if you are going to invent this infantile fantasy then why would you bother conceptualizing  hell ?

    * << I think he misspoke about the book, it's most probably [Sources of the Self: The Making of the Modern Identity by Charles Taylor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37858.Sources_of_the_Self). Hell - so that children can keep rushing back to God the father ? >>

* 9:10 - Hell - Consequence of a serious error was eternal torment. Doesn't sound very comfortable. James Joyce had terrible nightmare as a child because of Hellfire sermons from Jesuits. (Probably in this book: [A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7588.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man)).

* 10:00 - Jesuits telling him hell was prison with walls seven miles thick and consumed with darkness and fire. People who were trapped there continually burnt by this dark fire that gave new light that also simultaneously rejuvenate their flesh. So that it could be burn off eternally.

    * << Sounds a lot like addiction and inability to delay gratification - you end up in a hellhole if you do that for long enough. >>

* 10:11 - Elaine Pagels wrote a book on the devil that talks about how christians invented hell as a place for their enemies. 

    * << [The Origin of Satan: How Christians Demonized Jews, Pagans and Heretics by Elaine Pagels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22470.The_Origin_of_Satan) >>

* 10:55 - Charles Taylor's idea that modern existential crisis is akin to medieval hell.  

* 15:00 - Alexander Luria - function of the PFC. Women's brains more diffused.

* 15:39 - Both the hemispheres have quasi independent consciousness.

    * << What's the minimum amount of brain circuitry required for consciousness to emerge ? >>

* 16:38 - Goldberg -  Brain Right/Left - routinization - non-routinization, novelty/familiarity - chaos/order.

* 17:13 - Negative thinking is something you feel when you encounter something you don't understand. (Related to images).

* 17:26 - Left takes all that inputs and develops something that is more algorithmic and fully understood.

* 17:38 - Left tries to enforce order (Ramachandran - neurologist in California).

* 18:20 - Dreams - information moves from right to left in small chunks.

* 19:16 - Right brain - exploration - action - stories/poetry.

    * << I thought language centers were in the left side of the brain How do they communicate to creative these creative works ? >>

* 19:25 - What it is that we are biologically adapted to is reality (Darwin). Implying world is made out of chaos and order.

* 19:47 - If nature is what selects and nature has evolved this brain with two hemispheres (chaos and order) then you ca make a pretty strong case that nature is chaos and order.

* 20:30 - Bible is akin to library. Written by many authors over time.

* 21:00 - 22:50 This is a problem of self-consciousness - the fact that we are going to die and we know it.

    * << I don't see people around me worried about that - everyone seem to be in party mode man if you scan their social media at least. >>

* 25:18 - That's what it looks to me. You are welcome to disagree.

* 25:57 - Rest of the bible is about what to do about that.

* 26:10 - 26:22 The idea that you protect yourself from tragic consequence of self-consciousness is by reorganizing into a state.

* 26:30 - State begins to manifest it's pathologies. State becomes unstable and collapses and so on.

* 26:49 - Now people start wonder whether state itself is redemptive is not correct idea.

* 31:23 - 31:52 **Just by asking for help you have admitted that problems exist. Then if you tell me about them I know what they are. Then maybe we lay out some solutions and see if they work. But if you don't admit they are there and you won’t tell me where they are. How is that going to work ?**

* **31:52 - **It may be comfortable moment to moment while we stay encapsulated in our delusion.

* 33:45 - 34:09 People can handle a lot but not deception (esp. By people they love and trust). It makes them ill - psychophysically. It also makes them bitter and resentful and then they act it out in this world and that's terrible.

* 2:50 - Really excited about this lecture.

* 3:51 - Trinitarian idea - an a priori structure is needed for consciousness to emerge. Produced over vast span of evolution.

    * << KInd of reminds me of what I learned during meditation about how first a emoption shows up on the body, and then we become conscious of it. Why are we trying to solve the problem of AI by human terms in the sense that make them more like us. What are we trying to make them in our image.  >>

* 8:48 - Visual stimuli activating your body. Picking up the water bottle.

* 15:35 - If you don't tell people the truth then people around you don’t know who you are.

    * << Wow, I had this friend once, it's not that he lied, it’s just that he would not express himself. I was always frustrated that I know for all this time and I don’t even know who you are. Some people just don’t feel the need to express - so difficult to really know them. >>

    * << There you go again. >>

* 35:02 - **We act things out before we understand them.**

* 36:02 - When explaining the behaviour of animals, rules are human constructed to explain their behaviour. For animals it's not a rule but stable behavioural pattern.

* 36:59 - Sociologist trying to push that there is no morality, ethics are arbitrary.

*  45:25 - **When you confront the unknown and gain something of value that improves your position in the hierarchy.**

    * << That answers the question a viewer asked in I think in the lecture where he talks about Jacob. A lot of valuable ideas have come from people being out there own their own, humans being social creatures, Why are we evolved to have this behaviour where individual confronts the unknown rocking himself and brings something back that is of great value to the whole group ? Maybe these people who confronted the unknown were villains in the sense that their other attempts to attain the hierarchy had failed. >>

* 46:52 - The idea that you seeing things and then act is not correct esp. When they are emotional.

    * << Ideas emerged out of actions that were already there. >>

* 48:13 - **How you generate wisdom ? You act in the face of the unknown, then you dream about it. Then you speak about it.**

* 1:05 - slide - John 1:1

    * In the beginning was the Word

    * And the Word was with God

    * And the Word was God

* 1:30 - god is also the ability to play with time, which is what we do when we interact with the bible 

* **6:30 -** you are often extremely excited when you discover something full of potential, you see a future beckoning for you, if only if you interacted with it - it activates your nervous system, the ancient hypothalamus dopaminergic system activates, responds to potential (possibility of accruing something new and valuable) and propels you forward with engagement towards reward - put forth in Genesis 1 - you see it in mythology and the holy trinity

    * the formless potential that makes up being when interacted with, it is the source that all things emerge and rise

    * then there is an interpretive structure (god the father) that must interact with potential to bring it to reality

    * then the individual (god the son) that to their own capacity, acts and speaks (the Word), to bring life to things and turn chaos into order (god the spirit)

* 11:00 - it doesn't seem intuitive to Peterson to view humans as god-like considering their flaws - so the idea that they have something divine in them that must be treated with respect, and that plays an integral role in the creation and habitation of chaos, is a magnificent and marvelous and remarkable idea, and is the cornerstone of our legal system - it is the concept of individual sovereignty and is shared **by anyone who acts civilised**

    * 12:30 - if you don't have that, it is very easy to develop a caste system

* 14:00 - free speech and rights

* 15:00 - it took us a long time to come up with the abstraction of consciousness

* 16:00 - it is easy to think you interact with a material world, but that isn't how you act, you act as if there is also potential and other forms in the world

* 16:30 - we act as if we have free will (and maybe that is false!) - and societies that are not predicated on this idea, do not do very well, they treat people as automatons, slave-like even

    * << What does he mean by well here? China is doing terrifically well economically. Although perhaps poorly on self-actualisation? Who knows?! >>

* **17:00 -** it is an insult to someone to suggest they are not responsible for their choices

    * << the elaboration here touches on discussions we had in the Maps of Meaning discussions - that we already treat people to the capacity of agency we believe they have - e.g. children, e.g. religion >>

* 18:51 - slide - Genesis 1

    * 1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth

    * 2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

        * Deep - endless deep potential

        * Tiamat the dragon below (chaos) and Abzu (order) formed a union - they gave birth to the first generation of gods

            * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiamat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiamat)

            * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu)

* **21:00** - humans created their world by leaving their safe spaces, and voyaged with their paternal courage into the great unknown / the deep / the chaos / the terrifying unknown, and conquered things out there, creating habitable order, generating the world

    * << Captain Potter has a phrase something like - when I feel fear, I do not let it win >>

    * << Tyler - fear exists to give birth to courage >>

    * << Srai - dragon exists to protect the inexperienced from the gold >>

* 23:00 - fundamental debates inside relationships are using the same ancient neural circuits that our ancestors used to go out into the great unknown - we just do it abstractly now instead of concretely

* 24:00 - what are the fictional plots - adventure and romance

    * << Adventure masculine, romance feminine >>

* 26:00 - Dante's Inferno was trying to get to the bottom of what constituted evil- betrayal is the worst evil..

* **27:00 -** Ebay - trust is the most powerful economic force

* **28:00 -** if you act consistent to your word, then your word simplifies you - and if two people do it, they can use words to predicate actions (for the past, present, and future) - but if one betrays another, then the snakes unleash - relationships require trust as it is the only thing that stops the thin ice you are standing on from cracking and putting you into the underworld into incredible complexity, in the present, past, and future - betrayals disorient people despite no physical senses being fooled, they move them from one map and perspective of reality, one place, to another

* 31:00 - we go to the underworld all the time - there is always a snake that can bite you, always something that can do you in

    * << ties in with the god abuse conceptualisation from the discussions from last week - [2017 Week 49 - Meaning #1 & Bible #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djAn5r7fbdE) >>

* **31:30** - garden of eden is archetypal because we always inhabit a walled garden - and the snakes are also in the walled garden, you can't get rid of all of them, you can only get better at managing them

* 34:00 - some things are more real that we immediately perceive - a good work of fiction is something that is more real than the stories it derives, otherwise it has no staying power

* 35:00 - you don't need to scratch that far underneath the surface of people’s lives, before you find something truly tragic - most people are acutely aware of how they can improve and what they should and could be, otherwise it could be narcissism

    * << ties in with the cognitive dissonance recap from our summary session last week - [2017 Week 49 - Meaning #1 & Bible #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djAn5r7fbdE) >>

* 38:00 - nakedness isn't about sexuality, but about modesty - the judgement of the social world focused on your self-evident inadequacies

    * << ties in with Daniel Defoe's analysis of this exact same thing in his book [https://archive.org/details/treatiseconcerni00defo](https://archive.org/details/treatiseconcerni00defo) >>

    * associated with neuroticism in the big five trait model - they do not like having their weaknesses and vulnerabilities exposed to the group - one is humiliation and the other is mortality and death

        * << would be why neuroticism is associated with makeup use - as well as health conscious - as well as fear of public speaking >>

* 40:00 - Jung had the beginner's mind

* 41:00 - if religion was the opiate of the masses, then communism was the methamphetamine of the masses

* **41:00 **- in the underworld, you no longer know who you are, or where you are going

    * << reminds me of Inception, as well as Robin Williams - What Dreams May Come - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/) >>

    * and where you begin to nurse feelings of resentment, grievance, and homicide - can be traumatic for people who can imagine these nursings - sometimes for good reasons, but if you nurse it to the extent you turn against being itself, that is no good solution, it just makes everything that is bad even worse

        * << reminds me of The Shack - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872518/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872518/) - as well as Prisoners - [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392214/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392214/) >>

* 43:00 - slide

    * 3 And God said, "Let there be light" and there was light

    * 4 And God saw that the light was good

    * 5 And God separated the light from the darkness

        * For light to be created, it is the emergence of the conscious being

    * 6 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night

    * And there was evening and there was morning, the first day

* 45:00 - animals don't seem to exist until they are named - reality to us is tools we can use, when things have names, they become tools

* 48:00 - Heidegger - the fundamental essence of human beings is they care about things, either negatively or positively, they care

* **49:00 -** people who are bent and vengeful are always looking for reasons why they can not be responsible for anything

* 50:00 - environmentalists that want genocide

* 51:00 - a lot of existence is trying to exist with a minimum amount of pain

* 52:46 - slide

    * 6 And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. And god called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

        * **56:00 **- if you are feeling heroic, and you want to do something for the world, and you want to expand what you understand, you poke your head through what you know - if you jump right out there though, you might fall off the edge of the earth, especially if you do it accidentally

            * << post-modernists >>

        * 57:00 - books: Notes from the Underground - if you gave people everything they wanted, the first thing they would do is go insane and smash everything up, so they had something interesting and unknown to do

            * << I have doubts about this… Wall-E and the Matrix and Natzi Germany and the Safe Space epidemic are all examples where people want complete order >>

        * **58:00** - you want to orient yourself with one foot in the unknown, as that is where you are alert, alive, and with it - that is active engagement and the flow state - the sense of tragedy recedes, and your brain signals to you that you are in the right place, and what you are doing is meaningful - you are in the right place and the right time when this is happening

            * << I feel this when I explore or drive a motorbike - however it is very hard to feel this in the abstract conceptual world >>

            * << you've your finger on the pulse >>

        * 59:00 - the problem with being where you know, is that you don't know everything - and if you know nothing, you are in anxiety panic *disorder*

    * 1:01:41 - Goethe wrote a play - philosophy - look around the world, it is nothing but a bloodbath and ruin, it would be better if it never existed at all - this comes to mind in realm of despair - suicidal people say nope - that being would be better if it had never been - this is a terrible philosophy, as it makes the very things that led you to despair far worse - if suffering produced you to want to make being end, than causing more of that suffering does not seem the correct solution - columbine shooters

    * 1:05:00 - is something better than nothing? Maybe it depends on how you are. Being requires suffering, there is no escaping that, but there are modes of being that makes that tolerable. People look for people to admire. We look for heroes. What on earth else do you have to do besides being a light in the darkness, a call to being?

    * 1:16:00 - Guinea Worm [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculiasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracunculiasis) - one guy thought the world would be better without these, and he set out to do it - this is a lot better than trying to increase undue suffering

* 1:18:43 - slide of Michelangelo's God with kids and a bottom

* 1:19:00 - Dante's Inferno. Milton’s Paradise Lost. Nature of being. Nature of evil. Life is a profound problem for all of you. Being conservative and withdrawing from life’s complexity doesn’t protect you from the ultimate questions of life. It is better to confront them full on, and become a beacon of strength. That not only generates wisdom, but wisdom also allows you to deal with the tragedies of life. You want to be strong and reliable, and to do that you need to be wise, and to be wise you need to be integrated and together, and to do that, you need to know where you came from and what you are like. That was the histories and humanities. Man does not live on bread alone. Great art isn’t just beauty, it is also something that feeds the soul.

* 1:24:00 - old testament god, a lot of people wonder why believe in a god like that - however believers of that god, know that in life, you better bloody watch out, because otherwise you'll get smacked - it doesn’t matter if you approve of him, all that matters if you better pay attention or you will be in real trouble - there is real wisdom in that

    * Nietzsche really admired the old testament as a work of literature, and accurate

    * New testament, you are suppose to act towards God, as if he is nothing but good - however if you act in that manner, then it becomes more likely to be true - if you act with courage and faith, then that is better alternative than not acting that way

* 1:26:00 - I'm going to act as if being is good - there isn’t any better way to act in life

* 1:26:00 - This all has something to do, with the voluntary acceptance of mortality - the poisoned apple - it is very difficult for the knowledge of mortality to not poison your existence - mortality is the price you pay for being, accept it openly not begrudgingly - so therefore, I'm going to act as if being is good - an act of courage is required for that switch, it is a courageous attitude, but the alternative seems to be far worse

## @srai

* 02:15 - Christ is the same force God used to make order out of chaos in the beginning. 

* 03:25 - Stumbling block to purely object view of the world is consciousness.

* 03:30 - What constitutes time in the absence of consciousness is not very clear. If the movie is running and no one is watching.

* 04:26 - If all of us weren't here cosmos will continue to run depends upon what you mean by cosmos. Subjective experience of reality is what makes reality.

* 06:37 - Humans use consciousness to make order out of chaos. Unfulfilled potential.

* 07:04 - What could be only if you interacted with it properly !

* 07:58 - There are always 3 elements that make up mythology at bottom-most level. Formless potential, interpretive structure, and consciousness.

* 12:05 - The idea that every human being with all the shortcomings have something divine in them. This idea seems to be at the bottom of our legal system.

    * << It's probably at the bottom of how people treat each other in the west also. In my country people are in your face, not respecting your physical boundaries, showing reckless disregard for life all the time. Kind of difficult to live in an environment like that and think there is something divine in humans. >>

* 12:34 - Some people are contemptible and easily brushed off seems to be the default idea.

    * << Ya that's what I experience in my country at least. Unless you look like that kind of person who can hurt others and is intimidating or have power, people will just fuck with you. It’s very hierarchical.  >>

*  13:09 - We dispense with that idea (every human being at something divine in them) at our own peril.

    * << I don't have a study to quote but after living in a culture that doesn’t think there is anything divine in every person (until you acquire power - then people will kiss your ass from morning till evening) and every person should be treated with dignity, I can tell ya Peterson is right about this. If there was a society that treated people better you would just migrate to that. And if this society only let people in who has certain kind of talents that would be useful for them - boy that society will catapult to the top so fast. So the right is not so wrong about immigration in that sense - we should only let people in who are the best and can help us. Else you are just creating a situation where people are escaping things to come to your land but they bring their own culture with them - the one they are escaping in the first place. If the culture of your home country is so great why are you escaping it bitch. It hurts me a lot when these fuckers go to west and don’t respect their culture which to me is the force that is responsible for all the things west has achieved, maybe not directly but it’s the underlying culture that allows you to be free and creative where you don’t have to watch your back all the time. I can’t even cross the road in my country without the fear of being run over by some asshole. If your culture puts you in fight or flight response for no good reason then it hurts your creativity. You have got to be a tough cookie to still be creative in a shithole like that. >>

* 13:17 - If you didn't take that idea seriously then you wouldn’t act it out. You do act it out by being law abiding citizens.<< Fuck that’s what I admire about the west. Like I have been ranting before - over here rule of law is kind of a joke. People break rules left and right. Some learned person said something like they are innocent of the rules. When they look at the red light they don’t see what you and I see. How do you deal with people like that ? And there is a party in the west that wants to import as many of these fuckers as they can. You turn west into the kind of shithole that are other parts of the world - people like me would have no place to escape to.  Kind of reminds me of this speech by [Reagan](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm). Excerpts (keeping the original font and color):"Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, "We don't know how lucky we are." And the Cuban stopped and said, "How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to." And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth."Fuck I have got this lecture to finish otherwise I am so tempted to listen to the whole speech again. >>

*  13:25 - This idea is firmly shared by everyone who acts in the civilized manner.

    * << I do think that progressives SJW types have no conception of this idea. To them you (as a member of white privilege) group have less of a worth then the "victim" class. I have been a victim of my own incompetence and still am. The only way to get some dignity is to work hard and be better. Even if I get what I want by telling everyone I am a victim, is it even worth it ? It's not something I created by developing my talents you know. If God gave me a wish would I want him to achieve my dreams for me ? Just like that I will be on top of Mount Everest without ever having to take the trouble of climbing it. I’m not saying these people are not victims of something (but they are not always victim of what they claim to be either - it’s all in their heads many times. Say it isn't - so what. It’s ok if some white people hate me just because I look different. Hell I have got lot of people like that in my own country), but living like a victim is not worth it because I have done it. I was fortunate enough to have certain kind of curious attitude and ran into people who directed me to self-growth idea. Oh Lord, do I wish that for more people. I do wish that for more people so that they don’t have to do any of this. It hurts me to look at what they are doing to themselves and their country. I wish somebody had done the same for them. Hell, why not study people who were not white and they succeeded widely. It’s not impossible to do this kind of research these days with The Internet and all. If west is so stacked against people of color how the fuck did anyone of color every succeed. Motherfuckers are trying to turn the best place on this planet into a hell-hole.	**If you are looking for a racist you will find one no matter where you go.** What do I mean by that ? Well to give you an example say I have a belief that people laugh at me. So, whenever I walk down the street and people approaching me are laughing, I will be like there you go again they are laughing at me. Someone who don’t have this belief and is in a good mood will look at same bunch of people (who are laughing) and probably say: wow ! There are a bunch of people having fun. He might even say hi to them. If you think white people are a bunch of racist pigs then you are more likely to attribute the misfortune that befalls on you to racism. Off-course they didn’t promote me, I am not white. This is a vicious cycle. If you attribute cause of your issue to something external like racism then how can you self-reflect and change ? Maybe the guy who got promoted is better at something that you are not ? If you just brush it off as discrimination then you are not using it as a chance for self-improvement. Boy I can tell you it is hard. This self-improvement thing. It is hard. But what choice have I or anyone got if our parents didn’t leave us with some kind of treasure. What choice have you got man ? If you are not strong, self-reliant then you are just at the mercy of others. How can you ever even stand up for what you believe in when you are in the state of dependence ? How can you shape your life in the image you want ? And even if these so called evil rich white people gave you all their wealth - you think you will be able to maintain it and  grow it ? You can lose your fucking mind trying to do that because it’s hard. Fucking arrogants pricks man who thinks this world owes them something or they are entitled to something. You are not even entitled to a condom when life is fucking you in the ass without any mercy (**[I know you should b**e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT-mSima3CE) - fuck man these cartoons are too funny ). Now don’t misunderstand, we all have been down and need help. We help each other, we support each other and we can do that without being pinko commie assholes. If this sounds hard then I promise you it’s less harsh then what life will do to you if you don’t get your act together. What the fuck you think I am trying to do here with Peterson lectures. I’m 27 and I still don’t have the needed discipline and mental toughness. Long way to go. Another thought I have is not related to Bible studies is that If identity is psychologically constructed like gender then why not declare yourself as white and enjoy white privilege. >>

* 14:06 - There is something to speech that is more than just mere thought. Supporter of Free speech.

    * << Here he gives a divine angle on free speech >>

* 14:19 - Free speech is the force that manufactures everything.

    * << or improves everything. An culture/society/religion that doesn't engage in open dialogue about the issues at the risk of offending people will fail to improve over time. Earlier we were discussing how can Islam stay the same and not change when we are seeing changes at other places.

* 17:24 - It's an insult to someone to suggest that they don’t have free will or they are not responsible for their choices.

    * << I feel the same way when big govt. Folks keep saying Govt. is the solution, its an insult to individual's potential. I would much rather have a society where people help each other. >>

* 19:35 - The meaning of Genesis lines is found somewhere else in the Bible. To understand that you have to know the original language.

    * << If Peterson has been chasing these ideas seriously for a long time then - why didn't he commit himself to learning that language so that he doesn’t have to reply upon other sources ? >>

* 20:01 - Word that are used for "Without form" and “void”.

    * << He talks about how that has something to do with Chaos and Order. >>

* 21:12 - God is akin to the idea that someone confronts the dragon and creates the world out of its pieces.

    * << That's how we humans created the world - by going out of our confined safe spaces. Again Islam is not willing to do that neither it seems our SJW friends.  It's interesting how these people don’t want to fight the unknown, but willing to find their fellow humans to make them confine to your ideas. I think it’s only because they know other side will fall in line. That’s why Trump phenomena is so interesting - he fights back against these bitches and don’t take shit from nobody (anybody). >>

* 22:30 - 24:20 - Talks about how we use the same circuitry in an abstract way that we used to deal with and explore unknown environments while evolving. This makes it so easy for us to daemonize our enemies because we are using the same serpent detection technology.

    * << Again confronting people who disagree with us is sometimes needed for growth. Sometime my friends confront me about certain behaviour pattern that I know is wrong but don't want to fix. That makes me angry, and sometimes we fight. But at the end of the day I have to understand their point of view if I want to grow. It’s very difficult and it hurts. >>

* 24:51 - An hero is someone who slays the enemy. No exactly an politically correct term.

    * << WTF is up with these people in the west man ? An idea of hero kicking ass is politically incorrect. What, am I supposed to become a pussy now ? No wonder people like Trump when he says - we are going to win, win and win. You will get sick and tired of winning, and say can we lose a couple just so that we stay humble. >>

* 25:40 - Star Wars - you line up for 3 days to be the first one to be in theater.

* 26:15 - 28:40 Talks about what this without form and void means and brings up Dante's Inferno. Betrayal at the bottom of the hell. Economic utility of trust - says trust is the reason why ebay was successful.

    * << He is exactly right I think, In India shopkeepers sell poor quality products all the time. I bought a faucet for the bathroom and it started leaking the moment I put it in. Looks like there is culture against building quality products here. People try to cut corners all the time. So that's why I won’t use ebay. I just go with amazon by default. >>

* 28:52 - What happens when the trust is betrayed ?

* 32:15 - Walled garden - order and nature. Human beings will much around with snake.

* 33:45 - We only see day-to-day reality and not external structures of reality with our senses. Those needs to be imagined.

* 35:43 - You don't have to scratch very fal beneath the surface to find tragedy in someone’s life.

* 36:27 - Run into someone who says I am hell of a guy and I don't see how I can do better. 

* 37:04 - Humans enter history after the problem in the garden. Now they have to sacrifice joys of the present for the future constantly. You also know that you are going to die.

* 37:48 - Paying something back to the reality for the crime of existing. Offer something of value to people around us so that they can tolerate us.

* 39:29 - Rise of consciousness in Adam and Eve.

* 40:43 - Carl Jung studied these stories like a beginner, as if he had something to learn from it.

    * << It's really interesting how for the most part he doesn't laugh himself when audience is laughing. He maintains a serious face and keeps going. Kind of unlike other speakers.  >>

* 41:28 - You don't know where you came from, where you are and where you are going ?

    * << Now I am beginning to somewhat get this idea that you have to be something specific. I am sitting here in from of my computer, tired, my eyes hurt. Out of all the things I could do I am doing this and I want to keep going. >>

* 42:15 - When you are betrayed you will go to places you never would have gone to in your right mind.

    * << Idea being you will either turn very violent towards other party who did you harm and/or inside your own being. >>

* 42:30 - Revenge is hell. If you are in a situation that you don't understand. It’s one step from being confused to being totally outraged and resentful. Then only one step from really looking for revenge. That can take you to places that merely to imagine can be traumatic.

    * << I agree, I deal with this kind of shit all the time. Why is revenge bad ? If someone is out to get you everytime, it makes sense to fight back and kick their ass doesn't it ? >>

* 43:18 - Sometimes revenge can be for good reason but betrayal can share you faith in being itself and if you turn against the being itself (will make things even worse) - that's not good.

    * << How does betrayal shake your faith in being ? Is he talking about being as in yourself or being as in abstract term 'being'. Besides how does turning agains being itself will make things worse ? >>

* 43:41 - God separated light from darkness. Elements of our consciousness being.

* 44:37 - Use of language here needs to be noticed: "God Said".

* 45:04 - God is naming things, Adam was also asked by God to name animals.

* 45:50 - A thing exists before it has a name, but in a way it doesn't exist.

    * << Naming a thing means it been visited by consciousness. It's interesting how speed is very important and as a free human being I have not yet mastered the art of articulation. >>

* 46:57 - They (chimpanzee) were never able to pass on their ability to speak (if they had it) to their next generations.

    * << Why ? >>

* 47:10 - We parse the world with our ability to speak.

* 47:20 - What's happening here has no cosmic significance. Transformation of consciousness might be the most important thing anywhere. 

* 48:16 - Transformation of consciousness in early Biblical stories is not trivial. Rocks don't think.

* 48:37 - It's not all the same to us. Heidegger - you either like or dislike something.

    * << Caring is a big responsibility. >>

* 49:42 - Trivializing your existence has a dark side to it. If you as a being don't matter then you don’t have to do anything. Deep hatred of humanity that underlies those claims.

* 59:29 - Read youtube comments - some environmentalist saying something like planet would be better off without people on it. If you say that and listen to yourself.

    * << >>

* 51:08 - Hatred for humanity at the bottom of extremist environmentalist. Exist without relative minimum amount of pain.

* 51:44 - Scratch just beneath of surface of people. Struggling forward when surrounded with constant tragedy.

* 53:14 - Pronunciation of "Phenomenological"

* 54:00 - Half geographical, half empirical and half psychological.

## @John

* 10:00 "There isn't a Christian figure for 'potential'." 

    * <<I'd say certain aspects of christianity have Jesus as that figure.>>

* 19:00 formless and void = limitless potential. 

    * <<In Jung's book everything unknown that makes up the chaotic world is the unconscious, because we haven't consciously understood it yet. The unconscious is the label or representation of God. So the more we comprehend the world the weaker, unfortunately, he becomes and the stronger, or more capable, we become, growing closer to becoming like God. Now as God is an infinite, any power taken away from him is completely inconsequential in relation to the whole. There's also that idea of our own spirituality that ascribes uncategorizable experiences onto aspects of the world we inhabit, that's an element of God within us. Using drugs or any right brain activity reminds us of our own insignificance.>>

* 24:00 **We view our enemies as that unknown element, the snake **

    * That we fear and hate since we cannot categorize it into our conscious model of the world (liberals can't handle that they would become Nazis) and that allows them to treat their enemies in horrible fashion.

* 28:00 **Trust is what keeps the world running.** 

    * That faith for the good, the divine aspect within the other person to win the fight inside between good and evil

* 29:00 

    * That's why Jaws was so successful, it told people that this place they thought was safe could actually hold the potential of death inside the water.

* 46:00 

    * Our perception of existence is predicated on being raised on a day-night cycle, and from having an agricultural upbringing, but there's still objective rules unrelated to that that still are true when looked at from that model. Like the properties of light or atoms. But it seems, being people of earth it seems most fitting to realize existence from a singular, earthly perspective

* 55:00 

    * In Daniel, The dreams of the heathens in scripture could still be interpreted to be true. The statues and God's that they'd create were a manifestation of those dreams, so they literalized their dreams to worship them.

* 1:00:00 Our brains are designed to find meaning whenever exploring outside of the boundaries of what we already know. 

    * That's how we evolved so much compared to animals. We were developed with a built in 'flaw' Eudaimonia.

* 2:31:00 Asking yourself 'What could I have done to make tomorrow better than today was' is a kind of form of prayer

## @balupton

* 1:10 - slide - why bother doing it? Nietzsche, Jung

* 1:30 - a book can be more durable than an empire - one of the most durable things ever

* 3:00 - best way to learn something is to talk about it

    * << youtubers >>

* 5:10 - the ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten

* 6:00 - moving from slavery, to self-imposed slavery is a better option (discipline yourself to become something specific where you have the generality that you had as a child) - christianity helped play this role

* 7:00 - **thoughts rise up from the body (you could be angry and only until you cry, you realise what it was truly about) - the realm of the dream state, including stories, understands things we cannot yet articulate - if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream, then we become disassociated internally, we think things we don't act out, and act out things we don’t dream - this produces a sickness of the spirit - its cure is an integration of belief and representation** - so then people turn to ideologies to organise their thinking, but that is a disaster and Nietzsche saw this, he knew that if we knocked the slacks out of the dream state (i.e. Western civilisation’s god ideal) we would destabilize and move between the extremes of ideology (especially radical left ideology) and nihilism, and predicted two hundred years later, millions would die from the replacement of the underlying dream structures with this rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world - since then we’ve bounced between left and right with some good things occasionally and with sprinkles of nihilism and despair

* 10:00 - western individuals and society use their searching intellect to often undermine themselves and society in the search for something better, this is a threat to islam, and causes existential issues

* 11:30 - artists shouldn't question the utility being, it is an individual and social psychopathology, that begs for ideology (ideologies are like crippled religions), it is a situation where your rational being is divorced from your dream like creativity - it stops your being to saw the branch off that you are sitting on 

* 13:00 - **we must solve this problem, it one of the most important problems of mankind**

* 13:00 - belief systems regulate physical and psychological health - this is why people get so upset when those are challenged - it is poking of their axioms

* 14:00 - Nietzsche understood that each individual would need to create their own values

* 15:30 - Jung - articulated systems of thought are embedded in something like a dream, and we act out that dream through our everyday

    * 16:30 - made possible from our stories carried over through the generations, a process of understanding the dream of existence, of being human

* 17:50 - beginner's mind

    * << [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few." >>

    * << perhaps also the Jungian Fool archetype, which is the precursor to the Hero archetype >>

* 18:30 - psychedelics 

* 19:00 - Freud - you are driven mostly by unconscious motivations that are not consciously controlled

    * << Napoleon Hill constantly talks about how we must use our conscious mind to program our unconscious mind with deliberation, as if we do not, then our unconscious mind will be fed junk food, and act out junk actions >>

* 20:00 - Jung didn't believe Nietzsche, as how can we create our own values when we are unconscious beings

* 21:00 - Mars, the god that possesses you when you are angry

* 21:30 - **Jung - dreams and myths** - dreams give birth to the myth - story and storytelling - dreams are the birthplace of thinking - dreams express a reality that is still outside conscious comprehension and articulation << try describing a complex image in words and capture all the details >>

    * The words you use are the utterances of those long dead

    * The dream is the birthplace of ideas

    * That dream continues before and after you

        * << Dawkin's meme >>

* 25:00 - Genesis

* 26:00 - **Jung - dreams birthplace of thought**

* 26:30 - understanding dreams is connecting parts of you that were not previously connected - a realisation

* 28:00 - native illiterate carver, dreams in animals, dreams conversations with his grandparents

* 29:30 - dreams are acted out in traditions - orally, memory, acted out and dramatised, imaginative, written

* 30:00 - poetry was invented for us to remember the literal word

* 30:30 - why do dreams tell us things we don't know

* 31:00 - psychoanalysis is terrifying because you **understand there are things inside you that control you**, instead of the other way around - also known as spirits

* 32:30 - people can also dream nightmares that they wish to turn into reality

    * << seems peterson is misusing the term nightmare here >>

* 32:50 - nations can get caught in a collective dream

* 33:00 - artists, like dreamers, create things that they do not yet understand consciously completely

* 34:30 - where does the information in the dream come from? The revelations

* 35:00 - artists observe people and transit what they see - and the consumer understands to their relations but never completely, neither does the artist

* 36:00 - concerts and music can be religious experience - especially for young people

    * << why young people??? Less things have become banal for them? Less inhibition from society? >>

* 38:00 - dramas are played out on societies through time - artists try to capture this

* 38:30 - shakespeare isn't true factually, but perhaps is true in the way numbers are true, and abstraction of reality that pertains to reality

* 39:00 - not obvious abstractions are less real than reality

* 39:00 - hamlet

* 41:00 - rituals have lasted 20,000 years

    * << @srai: Well at least the meditation practices as well as religious teachings in my country were carried forward verbally for a very long time (>2500 years). Every new generation had to relearn them exactly without any change and pass them over to next without any changes (See: [https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/vipassana](https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/vipassana) this is the 10 day meditation I was talking about, they still follow the same technique).

* 41:30 - understanding is also what we act out

* 42:00 - how do you live in the world

* 43:00 - our acting is shaped by ourselves, and society, and we model it - that is where the dreams get its information, the dreamer watches everything - and the dream plays it out in drama - then we get the option to talk about it, and turn it into articulated knowledge - **and if we don't take notice of the cornerstone that that knowledge provides, we become lost in psychopathology**

* 45:30 - **there's more to your actions than you understand** - Jung said, everyone acts out a myth, and you should understand what you myth is, as it could be tragedy, and you may not want to act out a tragedy - are you being aimed somewhere you don’t want to go?

* 46:00 - almost every argument humans have is about understanding actions

* 47:00 - exodus - revelation of moses - law

* 52:00 - never confuse a sovereign with the concept of sovereignty - even the king himself is still subordinate to the principles of law

    * **In horrible dictatorships, the dictators didn't think they were subordinate to anything higher**

## @John Buck

* 1. It's contradictory document... (talking point: why. )

* 3. The way Peterson learns is to talk about it, and to teach it

* 5. Become a slave, ideally self imposed

* 10. The reason Islam is threatened is because the West is constantly breaking down the unknown, as we did for Christianity

* 12. That artist that JP knew is an example of divorced intellect from action.

* 15. The flaws of the 'superior man' which led to Nazism

* 21. The gods inhabit the brain (rage, love..) (talking point: Sagan's quote from Cosmos)

* 24. Dreams are aggregated thought.

* 27. And art and mythology are aggregated dreams.

* 35. ‎JP is focusing this lecture  on the rational, leaving the mystical currently for later.

* 39. Fiction can be 'true' like numbers are true, maybe truer.

* 44. He believes if we were purely rational, (descartes) religion would seem rational by contrast.

* 57. Every creation myth is born out of chaos.

* 1:00. If there are things that frighten you (the chaos, unknown), go after it.

* 1:12. How to interpret the bible...(talking point: Pardes)

* 1:14. If you can't comprehend the world around you then you become neurotic because you are surrounded by chaos      We’re neurologically developed to gain meaning from having an aim and progressing towards it, NOT by attaining it. Sisyphus (Yep) The unattainable abstract noble aim.

* 1:22 Walking through a field metaphor (talking point: sam's bulldog)

* 1:27 He's going only as far as were able to understand, but in order to act out the highest good sometimes we need to act outside of our own understanding, as Kierkegaard says Abraham did

* 1:28 the bible is phenomenological, the study of what has meaning, even nihilists can't continue in pain. But the absence of pain is not the end goal, it's necessary.

* 1:38 .  Source for genesis 2 being older than gen 1, I was under the impression they were all written by Mosheh - Moses- 

* 1:46.  You participate in the process of creation.  Wow.

* 1:51  The image of God is a trinity, does that work with the trinity of consciousness, id ego superego? The story of Moses talking God down from killing all the Israelites.  Abraham talking God down from destroying the 10 righteous men in sodom.

* 2:11 answered my comment from earlier

* 2:28 the interpretation of dreams is useful for the group.

* 0:00 - don't sacrifice who you could be, for who you are - you must sacrifice who you are for who you could be - when provided the option of staying stuck, that is the same, or transforming into something better, it is better to transform

    * You are the thing that transforms who you are

    * You should put the thing that becomes at a higher place than the thing that is

        * << seems justification for why we treat children better than adults, women better than men, and humans better than animals, and animals better than plants >>

    * Phoenix - do you want to be reborn? not as accurate as, do you want to burst into flames? Let the nonsense of this predicament burn away.

        * You can say, "I don't know what to leave behind" - but that is a lie, you know, all you have to do is ask yourself, you’ll immediately be able to come up with a list of a hundred stupid things you are doing that you should stop doing

* 2:00  - personality is what you are as a human being, and as an individual, and also what you can become

    * Crucial question of clinical psychology - who can the patient become?

        * The psychologist doesn't know what will get the patient out of bed in the morning, only the patient knows that

            * Psychologist only helps patient:

                * Specify the goal

                * Specify the transformation process

                * Help patient understand they will be bad at the transformation, but it doesn't matter, if you persist on something that you want to get out of bed for, you can get out of bed, you can get better with each attempt, and you eventually win

                    * Compared with a life of not wanting to get out of bed, or a life of attempting and quitting, or a life of failing/accomplishing aimlessly/meaninglessly

        * How is it that we may best obtain "what is the good"?

* 5:00 - scientific method removes value from its descriptions

    * Value propositions are in the domain of the subjective, which is what science leaves out for the objective

    * Determining - how you should be, do, and act - from facts, is flawed, as the facts don't have the value structure, and there is an infinite amount of facts

        * The facts do not tell you what to do with the facts

            * << this is why I have come to value Fox news - they don't just tell you the facts, they also tell you how to interpret the facts based on a shared collective value system - youtube commentary/reaction videos are much the same >>

        * You need direction, especially as direction is what causes positive emotion, and especially as positive emotion is what makes you move, and positive emotion defends against terror and pain, so if you want movement, then you need direction, and if you want direction, you need a value structure

            * You could say, what value structure?

                * Post modernists are wrong, as

                    * All value structures are shared, as life is a shared experience with other people, we are stuck with each other, so need a shared value system

                        * << call for nationalism? Also seems why Peterson sees there as a modern call to Christian values, as such, a christian identity, which ironically, is what Spencer would argue, is a white identity >>

                    * So despite there being an infinite amount of ways of interpreting the world, we must select from the limited amount of interpretations that actually are compatible with each other, in functional society

                    * Piagetian game proposition

                        * If you want to be a popular person of the playground, you gotta play games that others want to play

                    * Moral judgements emerge from consensus, which is a bounded domain

                        * << Is this why the left virtue signals? They find consensus in delegating the moral agency/responsibility/independence to the collective narrative - I can trust you, if you are also an operative of the narrative, as you are no longer an individual, and individuals are wildcards that are not to be trusted, as who knows what an individual could think! They could even thing hateful hurtful things by our narrative's standards! Blasphemy! Down with the individual! And individual thought! Only allowed approved speech and notions! Despite the fact, that they cannot control people’s mind — although, Orwell and Huxley new this, Orwell - control their minds by controlling their language’s expressiveness, as language controls thought -  Huxley - control their minds by controlling their technology, as technology controls culture — although, perhaps this is why the Leftists are crusading in the realm of Information Technology - if we control technology, we control culture, and control the world’s minds - this is certainly Google’s driver >>

                        * Bounded by the same place, and the same time

                            * This necessitates an iterative game, that hopefully doesn't spiral downwards, that we both don’t object to, as otherwise it doesn’t work, as people will either:

                                * Walk away and play another game

                                * Or it disintegrates catastrophically

                    * Not only do two people need to get along, but they need to get along with a value system, that doesn't cause the world to reject them - pretty much every single thing objects to you - nature wishes to kill you - hunger/sleep/hygiene/civility wishes to kill/distract you

                        * 9:00 - William James figured out the pragmatist perspective to value systems (the only genuine brand of American philosophy) - how do you decide if something is true, you can't as an individual because you don’t know anything, but you can lay out a mode of interpretation with an end point, run it, and see if it gets you where you want to get

                            * << how is this not scientific/objective, this is exactly the scientific method -  perhaps it is in, that the determination of the experiment, requires subjectivity >>

                            * You can also use this to figure out if your value system, interpretative framework, suppositions, are correct

                                * << this is Ayn Rand's "recheck your suppositions" trope >>

* 11:30 - you can also regard yourself in some sense, as a "loose self-regulated society", which is true psychoanalytically, as you are a collection of subpersonalities, subroutines

    * Between birth and 4 years old - you have to turn yourself into a unity - after that, you need to bring yourself into unity with the outer world - after that unity, needs to function within the constraints of the natural world

    * That structure is hierarchical, as some things must be more important than others, as otherwise you cannot act

        * That hierarchy is there to exclude and oppress, but also to focus and act

        * As you are stuck with the need for a value structure, the question is how to constitute it

            * To do that, you must be aware of its constraints

                * << perhaps peterson's focus on the constraints of IQ, to not delude us >>

                * Too lonesome could be that your value structure is too narcissistic

                * If a disagreeable person is depressed, get them to do nice things for other people

                * If an agreeable person is depressed, practice doing things for yourself, and being tough minded

                * If extroverted, spend some time reflecting alone

                * If low in openness, read a book outside your usual realm of interest

    * << what if their self-actualisation, is not good for society? And where environment no longer punishes them for it - via death, war, plagues, poverty, etc - are we doomed to societal collapse when living standards increase? Or is informed/voluntary population control of liberalism required - voluntary human extinction project, contraceptives, adoption over birth >>

    * If it devolves, you end up with nihilism, which then ends up with (predicted by Nietzsche and the existentialists)

        * Desire for someone (the tyrant) to tell you what to do

* 24:00 - Freudian slips often expose dragons that need disentangling due to their emotional identity - anything that made you upset, is the same as everything else that has made you upset - they are all dragons that become stronger - ask someone about a freudian slip, via free association, in they will wander around it exhaustively

* 27:00 - what is behind the game you are playing - everything that you are ignoring (outside your awareness) - always

    * Let's say you are in a class, and you get a bad grade - what is manifesting itself so that you get a bad grade? Why did you get the bad grade? - a bad grade is a piece of paper, but your limbic system sees it as a dragon

            * I am a bad person, I might as well jump of a bridge

                * Bad as; everytime you learn something you will make mistakes - if every time you make a mistake you jump off a bridge, that's not useful

        * As such

            * When you make a mistake, you don't get to beat yourself with a club - beating yourself up is a bad strategy, a super active super-ego, or just you, because you are disagreeable and neurotic and hyper conscientious

* 34:30 - When something objects, the question is, what does that mean?

    * It is which part of the structure at [18:15 - slide - Peterson's value system hierarchy slide] needs attention, which needs to be taken apart

        * Start with a little piece, see it fixes the problem, if it doesn't, only then move to a larger piece

        * Assume you are the least amount of reprehensible and ignorant as possible

        * Set goals that you can think you can accomplish

        * Each pursuit of goal, may arise new problems, those problems are likely different than the problems you are trying to address, they are likely just inexperience in a new better mode of being

        * You don't want to take yourself apart any more than is absolutely necessary

        * When a child does something not right - do minimal necessary intervention to prevent it from occurring in the future

            * << this is definitely not true in video games and movies - you let the bad guy or good guy flee over killing them, they will definitely come back and beat you next time - kill/eradicate the competition at every chance you get - use the appropriate weapon for the level of threat >>

        * With partners - what is the minimal thing you can request that will satisfy you? The minimal that you can accept? Specify it precisely and narrowly, with an escape route

            * If you want them cringing in a corner, then get that out of you, under control

            * << what does peterson mean by escape route? - as escape route for the motivations that maintains their dignity >>

        * Watch the people around you like a hawk

            * Whenever they do something that is good - you TELL them - that is wisdom man - you will get so far with that you will not believe it

                * Most people have become so cynical that any good they do is a rare attempt, so you squash or not notice that, they will return to their shell to make that attempt rarer

                * If you tell people the good that they are doing - they will be incentivised to keep doing it - and as well, to do more good things

                * If you like someone that you want in your life - you must

                    * Notice

                    * Tell them

                * You probably don't want to follow this advice, as you probably want to dominate others, and you don’t want them thriving, as then you will have competition - you must forego this pleasure if you want the other person to develop

                    * << is getting this out in video games, so you can be positive in real life, effective? >>

                * 40:30 - yeah you are stuck with them, it's good in that you settled, and you have one eye open - if you elevated your partner, you may not feel so resentful to them, and you may not be looking for an affair

                    * Do you really wish to see them grow? They may outshine you if you did?

                    * Or do you wish to see them tremble, cower, and falter?

                * This is also rough on kids, as parents can limit their kids so the parents do not feel inferior

* 41:00 - if life is a rat nest of misery, then why not devote yourself to reducing the misery to the minimal necessary amount

    * << of society? Or of yourself? >>

    * Move from self-imposed misery, to only the inescapable misery

        * If you do this, then life may become just a tragedy, instead of hell

* 43:00 - tragic circumstances bring out people's dragons, as stress is high, and all the things people haven’t dealt with, rise to the top, as they no longer have the nergy to repress the dragons

* 45:00 - one's plan, is their identity, the stick of wood they hold onto that is keeping them afloat in the ocean - when something that confronts you plan arises, be it a wave (or even someone trying to rescue you), an ideologue cannot let go of their plan, and they sink with it << staying in an abusive relationship, is an ideologue of a successful relationship >> - do not have your identity as the plan, have your identity as the thing that creates plans, that confronts the obstacles with plans, and obstacles are not just obstacles but opportunity itself - it is possible the thing objecting to you, is trying to help you formulate an even better plan, is that really a problem or an opportunity - this is really hard abstraction to apply to tragedies, but it is possible

    * It is pretty miserable to be digging for gold near someone's grave - but if they really loved you, then that is what they want you to do - be in the room and be helpful, rather the person who’s world is collapsing - be the useful person at the funeral - be the person who’s shoulder on which people cry - be reliable - be someone who can sustain a major loss without collapsing - and you gotta be a monster to do that

        * Roses and sunshine is pablum for fools

        * I couldn't live without them in my life - do you really want to curse someone with that kind of love - get away from people like that, run - the oedipal mother - the witch in the hansel and gretel story - the devouring force of love

            * << this really hits home for me >>

        * 50:00 - the death of your mother doesn't matter to you? What type of monster are you? Sometimes being a monster is the right thing

            * That's a rough thing to learn, but it is a necessary thing to learn

* 51:00 - if by the time you are 30, if what your parents think of you is more important than what your peers think of you, then you are confused, as by mid 20s, you parents are no longer your parents, they are now just peers, and you have confused your parents with god and you with a child

    * << seems of a force of religion for helping the practitioners through this transition of who is the parent, who is the child - in The Shack - there was many things, that portrayed the adults as children - certain mannerisms - I figured that was mistakes, but it could have been intentional >>

        * << ties in with point at 45:00 - those who die without their love by their side, are pathetic monsters >>

        * There IS NO non-monster alternative - you must either be WEAK or STRONG - not a WEAK monster or a STRONG monster - but a WEAK person or a STRONG person - the latter has an integrated monster, so they retain their humanity

You are not a city - you must cope with danger - you are the human - pick if you want to be the knight having an adventure conquering dragons and protecting the kingdoms that assist him - or the weak individual cowering from danger to get raped by the invading army - or do you wish to be the raping invading army, and live at threat of traitors - or rather, which sacrifices of happiness can you convince yourself of to pursue which future

    * Dostrovsky said if all you had to do was to eat cake, you would burn the whole system to the ground, as you don't want safety

* 4:00 - Why not position yourself for success rather than for failure?

* 6:00 - 65% of managers add zero or negative effect to companies

    * They can wipe out the careers of all they are supervising, and if they are higher up, they can bring the entire company down

    * USA is required by law to use the most effective means of hiring for talent in a non discriminatory way

        * Data seems to show that unstructured interviews are discriminatory - optimise for charming people, which isn't job performance

        * Conscientiousness is the best measurement for managerial success - they should use this

            * Combined with intelligence measurements, you get an even better measurement

        * Even with better bad measurements, it is huge economic potential - as the performance of competent vs incompetent people is vastly different

    * Measuring management performance is a difficult problem

        * 22:40 25:50 26:50 27:20 28:20 - Slide - The Behavioral Immune System & The Parasite Stress Hypothesis

            * According to the parasite stress hypothesis (e.g. Fincher & Thornhill, 2012; Schaller & Duncan, 2007; Thornhill & Fincher, 2014), levels of parasitic infection within a region may drive variability at both individual and societal levels

            * The avoidance of death or disability through avoidance of infection is a major evolutionary driving force

            * For example, until times that are relatively recent in evolutionary terms, almost 50% of children failed to survive to reproductive age (Volk & Atkinson, 2013), with the majority of deaths being due to infectious diseases

            * Local parasite types and hosts defense systems will typically be involved in a coevolutionary arms race, and so at any given time a host's immunological defenses will be specialized to be most effective against local parasite species (Thompson, 2005)

            * To the extent that a host defense system is specialized locally, contact with out-groups will be associated with an increased risk of exposure to infectious diseases against which there is no a priori immunity (Fincher & Thornhill, 2008)

            * The relevant infection-avoiding behaviors such as avoidance of strangers and high conscientiousness in, for example, food preparation, are assumed to arise from the operation of a "behavioral immune system" (e.g., Schaller, 2011)

            * The behavioral immune system comprises adaptive psychological response mechanisms that are sensitive to cues that might predict presence of infectious pathogens and which respond with appropriate cognitive processing and affective reactions

            * Such a system is likely to be oversensitive—the cost of a false positive (avoiding non-existent infection) is small relative to the possible cost (catching avoidable infection; Kurzban & Leary, 2001)

            * In social terms, an important component of the parasite stress hypothesis is that high levels of infection may lead to ethnocentrism, xenophobia, distrust of different others, and conformity (e.g., Murray, Trudeau, & Schaller, 2011; Neuberg, Kenrick, & Schaller, 2011; Thornhill, Fincher, & Aran, 2009)—because such behaviors will reduce the likelihood of exposure to unfamiliar infections to which immunity has not been developed

            * Disgust is considered to be one of the basic human emotions, defined by a strong revulsion and desire to withdraw from an eliciting stimulus or event (Darwin, 1872; Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000)

            * Physically, disgust is accompanied by distinct facial expression involving constriction of the oral and nasal cavities (Ekman & Friesen, 2003; Vrana, 1993)

            * Evolutionary models of disgust propose that this emotion evolved to help us avoid contaminated or harmful foods (Rozin & Fallon, 1987), or other potential sources of disease such as sexual contact (Oaten, Stevenson, & Case, 2009)

            * In addition to its role in directly helping to expel harmful foods from the body, disgust also forms an important component of the behavioral immune system, the suite of psychological mechanisms that aid in the detection and avoidance of potential contaminants before they can make contact with the body (Schaller & Duncan, 2007; Schaller & Park, 2011)

            * Although disgust may have its origins in the protection against physical contamination, a number of studies have implicated disgust responses in moral decision-making

            * Inducing disgust responses, whether via a foul odor, a disgusting work environment, or recalling a disgusting experience, led individuals to assign harsher punishments to others who had committed moral transgressions (Schnall, Haidt, Clore, & Jordan, 2008; Wheatley & Haidt, 2005)

                * << honour killings??? Does the conscientiousness of the jury/judge affect their punishments? Is that a bias that the progressives want to change? >>

            * Harsher moral judgements can even be induced following the consumption of a bitter drink (Eskine, Kacinik, & Prinz, 2011)

            * In addition, the same disgust-related facial expressions are observed in response to unpleasant tastes, disgusting photographs, and receiving unfair treatment in an economic game (Chapman, Kim, Susskind, & Anderson, 2009) 

            * Concerns about cleanliness and feelings of disgust heave likewise been related to political attitudes

            * Situational reminders of the importance of physical cleanliness, such as asking participants to wipe their hands with antiseptic wipes, tend to increase self-reported political conservatism (Helzer & Pizarro, 2011)

            * Such a finding is consistent with the notion that purity tends to be valued more highly by conservatives than by liberals (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009)

            * Concerns about cleanliness and feelings of disgust have likewise been related to political attitudes

            * Situational reminders of the importance of physical cleanliness, such as asking participants to wipe their hands with antiseptic wipes, tend to increase self-reported political conservatism (Helzer & Pizarro, 2011)

            * Such a finding is consistent with the notion that purity tends to be valued more highly by conservatives than by liberals (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009)

            * Individuals who report being disgusted more easily also tend to hold more conservative political views on topics including abortion, gay marriage, tax cuts, and affirmative action (Inbar, Pizarro, Iyer, & Haidt, in press; Inbar, Pizarro, & Bloom, 2009)

            * In addition to the effects that have emerged when using self-reported disgust sensitivity, more conservative political views have also been associated with stronger physiological reactivity to disgusting images (Smith, Oxley, Hibbing, Alford, & Hibbing, 2011)

                * << are low orderliness more likely to enjoy horror movies compared to high orderliness?? >>

                * << what is the orderliness of morticians?? >>

            * In particular, a large literature has converged on the notion that there are two core dimensions of conservative political ideology: resistance to change and tolerance of inequality (Jost, 2006: Jost, Federico, & Napier, 2009; Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003; Jost, Nosek, & Gosling, 2008) 

            * Resistance to change reflects the extent to which people wish to maintain the status quo, while tolerance of inequality reflects the acceptance of an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities within society

            * These two dimensions appear roughly aligned with social and economic conservatism, as expressed in the constructs of Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation, respectively (Duckitt, Wagner, Du Plessis, & Birum, 2002)

            * These core facets of conservatism are also closely related to the two higher-order value dimensions described in moral foundations theory, which reflect preferences for order and tradition on the one hand, and preferences for egalitarianism on the other (Graham et al., 2009; Graham et al. 2011)

            * Importantly, the motivational bases of these two dimensions appear to vary independently from one another, with an individual's overall political attitudes on a left-right spectrum emerging from their relative balance

            * These motives are also strongly rooted in basic personality characteristics, such that preferences for order and tradition are associated with higher levels of Orderliness (an aspect of Conscientiousness) and Politeness (an aspect of Agreeableness), as well lower levels of Openness/Intellect; in contrast, preferences for egalitarianism are uniquely associated with Compassion, an aspect of Agreeableness (Caprara, Schwartz, Capanna, Vecchione, & Barbaranelli, 2006; Carney, Jost, Gosling, & Potter, 2008; Hirsh, DeYoung, Xu, & Peterson, 2010; Jost, 2006)

            * Political conservatism can be thought of as a "social immune system", reflecting the extension of pathogen avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of the social system (Rozin et al., 2000)

            * Just as the behavioral immune system has been conceptualized as helping to maintain the purity and integrity of an individual body (SChaller & Park, 2011), so too many the same pathogen avoidance system help to maintain the abstract integrity of the social order

            * In particular, the social immune system would help to maintain order by suppressing any actions or individuals that deviate from a group's accepted social traditions

            * It has been reported, for instance, that regions with higher levels of disease prevalence tend to be associated with higher levels of social conformity (Murray, Trudeau, & Schaller, 2011) and autocratic rule (Thornhill, Fincher, & Aran, 2009)

            * Individuals who feel more vulnerable to disease likewise report higher levels of ethnocentrism and xenophobia (Navarrete & Fessler, 2006)

            * Such basic concerns about pathogen avoidance may thus contribute to the desire for order and tradition among conservatives, along with the harsh moral judgements associated with violations of the social order

            * In particular, severe moral judgements may be a key mechanism by which the social immune system (instantiated in conservative practices and policies) aims to eliminate exposure to deviant social elements that may increase the risk of pathogen exposure

            * According to a "parasite stress" hypothesis, authoritarian governments are more likely to merge in regions characterized by a high prevalence of disease-causing pathogens

            * Recent cross-national evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but there are inferential limitations associated with that evidence. We report two studies that address some of these limitations, and provide further tests of the hypothesis

            * Study 1 revealed that parasite prevalence strongly predicted cross-national differences on measures assessing individuals' authoritarian  personalities, and this effect statistically mediated the relationship between parasite prevalence and authoritarian governance

            * The mediation result is inconsistent with an alternative explanation for previous findings

            * To address further limitations associated with cross-national comparisons, Study 2 tested the parasite stress hypothesis on a sample of traditional small-scale societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample)

            * Results revealed that parasite prevalence predicted measures of authoritarian governance, and did so even when statistically controlling for other threats to human welfare

            * (One additional threat—famine—also uniquely predicted authoritarianism)

                * << how did the collective agriculture of Stalin/Lenin that caused famines end up being reversed, as should it not, given this, become stronger and stronger? >>

            * Together, these results further substantiate the parasite stress hypothesis of authoritarianism, and suggest that societal differences in authoritarian governance result, in part, from cultural differences in individuals' authoritarian personalities

* 00:00 - Big 5 can be broken into the Big 2 (stability and plasticity)

    * Stability (serotonergic function)

        * Conscientiousness

            * Industriousness

            * r=0.39

            * Orderliness

        * Emotional Stability / Neuroticism

            * Volatility

            * r=.59

            * Withdrawal

        * Agreeableness

            * Politeness

            * r=0.44

            * Compassion

    * Plasticity (dopaminergic function - mediates exploratory behaviour in the face of the unknown, as well as positive emotion - not so much you are motivated in the unknown, but motivated to explore the unknown - correlated with social environments, that is unknown exploratory environments)

        * Extraversion

            * Assertiveness

            * r=0.47

            * Enthusiasm

        * Openness to experience

            * Openness (Creativity)

                * Women higher 1/3rd sd 

            * r=.35

            * Intelligence (Intellect with ideas)

                * Men higher 1/3rd sd

    * Average correlation between Big Five r=0.22

    * Correlation between Big Two r=0.24

* 4:00 - business opportunity - don't have good non-self-reported measurements for things that are not IQ - peterson has been trying to do this for the last 5 years

* 5:00 - neuroticism is correlated with being self aware, self-consciousness is correlated with high negative emotion << perhaps why those who are aloof are happy >>

* 6:00 - two things social scientists have been able to measure well - IQ - and the correlation of income inequality and male homicide

* 7:00 - one of the problems of operating in the world, is you are faced with the question, of how to perceive the world, how to look at things (so you can use things in the world for the purposes you need to use them for) - this is one of the problems that intelligence tries to solve

    * 22:00 - then how do you act with those tools! Which is to say:

        * How do you perceive where you are now

        * How do you perceive where you are going

        * How do you construct a path to connect the two, and implement strategies to create the movement necessary

        * This is navigation - to attempt to make the world manifest itself in accordance with our wishes

            * Animals have their perceptions to rely upon, and humans have their perceptions and abstractions to rely upon, which eventually manifest themselves into language and creations

                * This then ties into the Temple Grandin tangent at 13:00

                * We live in a very abstract world

                * We can also take a lesson from somewhere, and apply it generally across other things

* 11:00 - we see the world as a discrete set of tools

* 12:00 - if you have a problem; Is it biological? Psychological? Environmental?

* 16:00 - iconic representations aren't what they represent, just a representation

* 19:00 - for humans, without goals, there is no perception

* 22:00 - a base of communication is establishing common knowledge/foundation to initiate the deviations of new knowledge from

* 24:00 - Cognitive Ability

    * The complexity of the world

        * Motivated ends must be met (can also be thought as value systems)

            * Extraversion

                * Social success

            * Neuroticism

                * Security and safety

            * Agreeableness

                * Cooperation vs competition

            * Conscientiousness

                * Order, duty, obligation, implementation

            * Openness

                * Abstraction: Ideas and representation 

* 27:00 - temperaments and brain structures

* 29:00 - when something unknown occurs, you have to guess how bad it will be - your score on neuroticism generally is the average score of how bad you rate things

* 29:00 - conscientiousness - how hard should you work? Well it depends on the stability of the future - if you put people in wildly uncertain circumstances, they discount the future - conscientiousness store goods for the future

* 31:00 - extraverts do not fare well under authoritarian systems << the current tech world >>

* 32:00 - people with higher IQs only seem to fare better in complex societies - also women mate select based on equal or higher IQ

* 33:39 - Cognitive Ability

    * Modeling of possibility prior to implementation

        * Models generate solutions to three problems:

            * Where are you?

            * Where are you going?

            * How are you going to get there?

    * These are problems of perception as well as strategy

        * Current and future situation must be conceptualised

    * Abstraction allows for testing and failure

        * Popper: "Our hypotheses die in our stead"

* 34:00 - Chimps hunting

    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1WBs74W4ik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1WBs74W4ik) 

* 34:30 - slide of brain

* 37:00 - how to figure out a successful strategy, and how are successful strategies calculated evolutionarily

* 38:00 - women and men are in a cognitive arms race, to outcompete each other << to consensually rape each other? - why compete, if not to dominate? >>

* 41:00 - slide

* 43:00 - understanding something, is correctly pattern matching it - such that it matches and is likely to be useable again - each match and use grow the circuits through dopamine - dopamine via cocaine produces hyper learning << should we all be taking cocaine for the study group… >>

    * [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2401819/Cocaine-use-boosts-learning-decision-making--increasing-dependency.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2401819/Cocaine-use-boosts-learning-decision-making--increasing-dependency.html)

        * Yes it increases learning, but simultaneously increases dependency on the cocaine

            * Interesting, as I think many students use porn simultaneously with study, which produces the same effects as cocaine

                * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2qY79eIRHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2qY79eIRHY)

* 46:00 - if micro-personalities were not able to suppress other micro-personalities, then they would never be able to run to their conclusion, and you'd never be able to get what you want

* 47:00 - imagery is the precursor to action - think about thinking, think, then act

* 47:53 - Conceptions of cognitive ability

    * Intelligences

        * Practical versus analytical

        * Social, emotional, moral

        * Multiple: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal

    * Intelligence

        * Highest strata has the most explanatory power

            * "G" measures “success” across broad domains - fluid intelligence

            * R~0.50

        * 1:00:00 - intelligence is your ability to play the metagame

        * 1:06:00 - faster reaction times, correlate to intelligence, at a 0.25 - how big our brain is, is also correlated - how big is your brain in relationship to your body << are midgets smarter??? >> - working memory is another - speed of electrical signals is another

* 48:00 - regression equations, covariances, measurements

* 55:00 - something is real if you can measure it, and it helps you predict

    * Reliability test (does your test measure accurately)

    * Correlationation test (if they are highly correlated, are they the same thing)

    * Factor analysis (common across all of them)

    * Can you predict from your measurement

* 59:00 - is there anything left in these so called intelligences, when you factor in IQ and Personality - no there is not - and the people who keep pushing them, are those who do not like the idea of real individual differences

* 1:07:32 - slide - Physiological correlates

* 1:07:55 - slide - Effect Size

* 1:10:00 - income inequality does not cause crime ONLY relative income inequality causes crime in the same area

* 1:12:00 - neuro-psychologists like to think that working memory is a thing in and of itself - but that is because they don't know a thing about psychometrics

* 1:13:00 - slide - Three-Stratum Theory of Cognitive Abilities - John Carroll

    * If you maximally differentiate the fragmentations, and they are still correlated at 0.9 (like what happens at IQ) you are still measuring the same thing

        * Personality however, fractionates into 2, then into 5, then into 10

    * If you are high in one aspect of IQ, then you are 0.9 high in another

* 1:16:19 - slide of the fractionations

* 1:18:00 - IQ seems to be generally increasing with each generation - perhaps from better living conditions and nourishment - but also perhaps from greater need and exposure to complexity - however trying to change an existing groups IQ is incredibly difficult with little gains - breast feeding raises IQ by 2-3 points with every year of breastfeeding

    * [http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Breast_feeding](http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Breast_feeding) - if there is a superfood, breast milk is it!

* 1:20:00 - IQ doesn't measure worth, it measures ability to interact and manipulate complex problems

* 1:20:00 - if you are going to measure something, or have measured something, you must make sure what you are measuring, isn't already IQ and isn’t already personality - and almost no psychologists do this!!!

* 1:21:00 - a good scientist wants to destroy their constructs, to not chase a ghost in a chimera

* 1:23:00 - why know these things?

    * For your benefit - don't get a job that is above your IQ - as you will become wretched, and make everyone around you suffer - do not take a job where your shortcomings in your IQ aspect will be your fatal flaw - find a profession where you will be in the upper % of intelligence, then you are a big fish in a small pond

    * For policy benefits

* 1:24:00 - if you are less conscientiousness, then you will value more leisure than work, and more power to you if that is how you are wired

* 1:30:00 - crystallized knowledge (accrue across time, the content), and fluid knowledge (what programs your brain, fills it with facts, it is the programmer) - the better the programmer, the better the content - that is why you can measure IQ by measuring crystallized knowledge, because the better the knowledge, the better the programmer

    * Under 85 IQ (15% of population) there are no jobs left - 83 IQ (10% of the population)

        * << Which population? Global, or USA, or Canada? >>

    * The more you go down, the simpler and more repetitive jobs they get

    * IQ is how fast you will master any video game

    * << how does this factor in differences culturally/geographically - is a manager/programmer in USA as intelligent as a manager/programmer in Indonesia? >>

    * << as a society progresses, it should expect a fixed unemployment rate based on the intellect percentiles of available jobs) >>

    * << importing stupid refugees with the hope that they will be able to provide for the aging population, completely ignores technology will force them to become unemployed - then as jobs become more complex in the developed world, stupid people will need to be exported to the third world (where the technology has not yet reached) in order to work >>

# [2017 Personality #17 (agreeableness)](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-17/64/1)

## @balupton

* 05:00 - men and women intersect on agreeableness and neuroticism in the middle 90% or so, but the 5% of people that are most disagreeable are never women, and 5% of people that are most agreeable are never men, that 10% does not intersect at all - they are outcasts of androgyny

* 09:00 - agreeable people really care about being liked, hence why they dislike conflict

    * Do disagreeable people care about being respected and thus must optimise for it? And then consequently, do agreeable people feel they are entitled to respect because they don't need to earn it?

* 09:30 - before puberty, sexes are the same personality wise

    * Men are overrepresented with learning difficulties - disagreeableness

    * Women are overrepresented with anxiety and depression - neuroticism - there is not much difference between top 5% in neuroticism and depression/anxiety

* 11:00 - size of bodies (strength and volume) is roughly the same before puberty - men get taller, bigger, and stronger

    * Women attack their husbands more than men attack their wives

        * << Peterson's assessment of this is incorrect - the data’s criteria is abuse, and abuse is severe - yes strength is different, but women amplify with objects, nails, repetition etc - men are also prone to not hurt women - Karen Straughan goes into this in detail >>

* 13:00 - cost for sex for women is higher than for men

* 14:00 - women/mother diad - caring for infants under 9 months

* 15:30 - adult men create competitive environments

* 16:00 - disagreeable people are tough-minded, competitive, and they won't do anything that they do not want to do - they look at the world as a place they can compete and win

    * 19:00 - people do not like being judged by the merit of the low performers that they get bundled with

        * Conscientious people judge you based on the merit of your accomplishments

            * << Is this what is behind the attack of merit in the information technology world? The effort to get identities in AT ALL COSTS may be getting non-conscientious people in, which may not be a good thing! >> 

    * 20:00  - advice to agreeable people to not be exploited - because your agreeableness wires you to be exploited by infants

        * **_21:00 - say what you think, even if it will create conflict - unless it is with infants_**

            * **_22:00 - it takes a lot of conflict to solve short-term problems, to avoid long-term problems_**

                * **_Disagreeable person - this is what I want, and this is what I'm going to do to get it_**

                * **_Agreeable person - often doesn't even know what they want, as they’ve only optimised for what others want_**

* 23:00 - if you want to be a criminal, be really low in agreeableness (things are for me, not for you, and you won't get me to do a damn thing I don’t want to do, and I’ll stand my ground), and really low in conscientiousness (you’ll do all the work, and I’ll take my benefits) - this combination makes them border on psychopath - if you add high intelligence and high emotional stability, then you have someone who won’t work, who’ll reap the benefits, who doesn’t give a damn about you, who is assertive as hell, and who is smart, and a person like that is likely to also be charismatic (extroversion and disagreeable are kind of narcissistic, but they will put themselves forward strongly, they won’t show signs of fear, which makes them appear confident, which is easy for people to confuse with competence, which is how psychopaths get away with what they are doing, although they need to move from person to person, as their reputation will crack)

    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley) 

* 25:00 - toddlers are the most aggressive humans of any age group

    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler)

    * The most disagreeable 2 year olds, with correct socialisation (learning to bring their disagreeableness productively into cohort with others) tend to be fine by 4

        * Rough and tumble play seems a large aspect of this

            * << Perhaps Ghettos in the USA just need martial arts for two year olds? With filters for paedophiles >>

            * ADHD medication destroys the kids play functions -- don't medicate the boys, have them run around until they are exhausted

        * Your job as a parent is to make your child socially acceptable by the time they are 4, as otherwise it is too late and you have failed them, as their peers will reject them, and after 4, primary socialisation occurs with their peers, so if you ruin that, it is game over, they will have a world of rejection

* 33:00 - creativity in men is 16-25, as well as criminality

    * << What is this? Can we drug it? >>

* 35:00 - if you are a good at one thing, it often means you cannot be good at another thing, at the same time

    * << seems this is constrained temperamentally, correct? >>

* 36:00 - conservatives like to put things in boxes, and do not like those boxes to mix - determinate and inviliable??? - scales from personal all the way up to the political - should the borders be open or closed 

    * 38:00 - pathogens killing 95% of local population

        * Peterson nails the real value of diversity and inclusivity, it is not with identity, again at 45:00 he nails it

            * 45:00 if you are introverted person, it is worth watching an extroverted person, as they will have ways of being that are remote to you, that you could leverage or mimic when you are able (it will be alienating to you when you mimic it, but that alienation should not downplay its usefulness)

* 39:00 - how to measure political correctness - oversample first, then nail it down, the statistics will take care of the excess << we should have done this with our timezone survey) >> factor analysis finds how things clump

    * Politically correct are liberals who are high in agreeableness 

    * Conservatives have more polite aspect than liberals, liberals have more compassion aspect than conservatives

        * << Hrmm, previously in earlier lectures I thought he said conservatives are low openness, high conscientiousness, and liberals are opposite) >>

    * PC Liberals high in openness, high in verbal intelligence, high in agreeableness

    * PC Authoritarians high in agreeableness, high in orderliness, negative in verbal intelligence - obsessed with language control

    * PC Liberals and PC Authoritarians are correlated to 0.1 - if there is unity, it will fragment into these two groups

* 43:00 - your temperamental proclivity, allows you to lay out a simplification onto the world

    * << this seems to be why trauma changes personality, as one must update their simplification, their map of how they and the world operate >>

    * If you are conscientious person, the world is a place to work

    * If you are an open person, the world is a place to discover new things, ideas, and experiences

    * If you are an agreeable person, the world is a place to go out there and discover and have relationships

    * They are the manner in which you are adapter to a particular niche

    * PC seem to divide the world into defenceless infants and predators, and that is blasted onto the political landscape, and things are conceptualised/judged on that temperamental variable

* 46:00 - to be well adapted for life, find a niche in your environment that is well adapted for your temperament - you should not work at cross purposes to your temperament, it is just too darn difficult (and soul destroying) - but having found that niche, you should expand yourself, to increase your welcomed competency

# [2017 Personality #16](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-16/63/1)

## @balupton

* 01:00 - part of an indicator of progress of science is that theories that were around 60 years ago are no longer right

* 01:30 - the working theory - motivations set goals, or rather they define a perceptual space in which you see the world and act towards some goal, some endpoint, that is specified the motivational system (a hypothalamus system often, but not always), they also tune your perceptions to things that you believe relevant that goal, and tune your motor systems / behaviour towards the goal - as you think about food, your body begins to prepare for food

* 03:00 - it is useful to think of a motivated state as a micro personality, albeit a simple one as it only has one thing in mind

* 03:00 - many emotions track progress towards goals << is that their purpose? >>

* 04:00 - the mental equivalents of pain are; grief, disappointment, frustration, loneliness - depression and people are grieving usually have somatic pain as well

* 06:00 - if you give opiates to people, it seems to subside their depression, dampening their pain, and perhaps those who are prone to negative emotions, will be more prone to opiates

* 07:00 - predatory aggression circuit and the maternal solicitude circuit seem to have evolved to be at the opposite ends of the distribution (the agreeable distribution) - compared to other mammals, men are quite caring to children and women are quite predatory to children

* 08:00 - panic seems different to the anxiety/fear system - panic is about escape

* 09:00 - book: affective neuroscience, fantastic about motivation

* 10:00 - men do rough and tumble play with kids, and kids love it, it is an excellent mode of socialisation, as it teaches the child the distinction between aggression and too much aggression - rough enough to be exciting, yet not enough to ruin the game, without rough and tumble play, you do not seem to know where your personal boundaries are, where you begin and where you end, and how much you can take and how much you cannot, children who have missed out on rough and tumble play are socially and behaviourally awkward << as the child grows older, the more it seems one revokes play from the child, as they seem more of an adult who should be responsible, perhaps there is a way to make responsibility playful, perhaps that is success - musk seems to do this >> play with teachers then pushes into a dominance dispute

* 14:00 - Swanson's elaboration on the fact that half of the hypothalamus is devoted to exploration

* 16:00 - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_locomotion)

* 29:00 - memory is keeping track of what is new and what isn't

* 34:00 - the behaviourists were right to the extent they were looking at a limited lower system - but there are many systems that interact with each other

* 42:00 - organise and integrate your motivations and personality, and do it with other people doing the same

* 43:00 - positive emotions (extraversion), negative emotions (neuroticism) - positive emotion seems to be what happens when you've put a motivational state to its limit (the state after eating after you were hungry) - once you satisfy a motivation, a different one will catch your attention

* 53:00 - if you can't solve a problem right now, focusing on a different problem is an exploratory move

* 54:00 - when an obstacle occurs that you did not account for, one of your suppositions fell through, leaving a hole in your meaning, this is met with anxiety or fear, that can cause spiralling meaning-correction, and once calm, exploration circuit arises to find solutions - which reaction seems equated to per unit of positive emotion to per unit of threat

* 57:00 - serotonin high is satiating/satisfaction << is the opposite true when serotonin is low? >> - dopamine is related to exploration circuits << perhaps why this is associated with games >> emotions are happiness/play/enthusiasm/novelty << covered at 45 minutes, but seems contradictory >>

* 1:02:00 - how to test if you're an alcoholic

* 1:04:00 - boys and girls have the same neuroticism, until puberty, where girls increase and boys decrease - this difference never goes away - women's biology/emotions are not tuned to the woman, but tuned for the woman/child combination << is a woman without a child a monster? >>

* 107:00 - when there is a deviation, the hippocampus looks inside you and outside you, if they are matched (you know what you are doing, and where you are) then it inhibits the amygdala and hypothalamus - the reticular activating system is what alerts your cortex when you need to become conscious - a lot of your systems are held back like horses behind the gate of a rate course, when something negative happens, they open the gates a bit, this is exciting and also release dopamine, as one way to solve a problem is to switch problems (exploration), one way to look at it, is to be prepared for whatever the hell you need to do next (alertness) - hippocampus detect anomalies, inhibits or activates lower systems, and gets you ready to go

# [2017 Personality #15](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-15/62/1)

## @balupton

* 02:00 - paper and book mentions - slide at 02:35

* 06:00 - hippocampus regulates emotional responses based on current circumstance/environment

* 12:00 - motivation - goal setting, behavioural driving, a set of schema where those things make sense - it is a one-eyed micropersonality - it is only aiming at one thing

* 13:00 - hypothalamus always wins over the cortex

* 17:00 - the brain is always working on the problem of what to ignore - and it must ignore almost everything making it blind to almost anything

* 22:00 - prior to the guerrilla experiment, psychologists believed we were primed to spot anomalies, but it turns out that is not the case, what is the case, is that we only notice anomalies only if they interfere with what we set out to accomplish << how does this relate to flow state though? as noises can be incredibly distracting, but sometimes we notice them as infuriating, and other times don't notice them at all - perhaps depends on the relative safety of the noise and its environment? not the case, as pop music is safe, but infuriating for concentration - yet baby boomers seem not bothered about radio/tv noise, yet perhaps they are not good at complex cognitive loads that require cognitive isolation and thus do not realise the impedance the noise makes - perhaps not about safety but comfort - if the noises are familiar in a current situation then they can be comfortable (repetitive noises) yet erratic rhythmical noises seem to interrupt to extent of cognition required to process their complexity - trivial noises are dismissed without cognition, mobile phone and computer sounds require more cognition to identity (which app, what meaning, whose phone, from who could this be), vehicles can be filtered out until a erratic sound occurs (loud motorbike, police siren changing frequency), erratic drips (is it the same drip? it sounds different, it is a different timing, has it gotten worse, when will I need to address it) >> - it isn't anomaly or novelty that captures your attention, but the unexpected disruption of your behaviours and the desired outcomes of those  disruptions - **only pay attention to things that can make you fail ****<< seems the essence of marxism/feminism/blame ideologies - not victimhood/empowerment ideologies, but blame ideologies - if it were ourselves we blamed, we could do something about it empowerment - if it is others, then we can only blame and accuse >>** also causes an emotional reaction (discussed more in next lecture) - emotional reaction prepares you for the worst case, and to update your expectations and desires to the changing world

* 22:00 - example of guerrilla experiment motivations - winning, compliance - tap into intrinsic motivations so we want to play the game - making us focus our very limited attention resources on accomplishing the motivation << ha, the secret! >> peterson goes onto talk about visual field blurry outside the pinpoint of detail << seems for the anomaly situation, we spot what we are primed to spot - someone with a masked face in a dark alley (survival motivation) - an attractive girl/guy (reproduction motivation) - an aspiring person (imitation motivation) - seems things outside our current motivations we do not see at all - only anomalies that impede our motivations - however, how does that work with confirmation bias, as that is for the dismissing of anomalies >> << how does this play into distractions? especially for when you get distracted from things that are valuable? - is it competing motivations, or a failure to regulate motivations and attention? >> noticing movement seems to be our brain keeping track of what is changing so it only has to update our representation minimally, thus eliminating the irrelevant - irrelevant of the motivationally driven interpretive frame that we are applying to the scene - the rule of perception is don't pay attention to anything that isn't related to the desired outcome - exactly how you calculate what you can pay attention to and what you can't, is knowledge you build over time, that you can be wrong about << the fault of our perception seems to be the equation of outside of motivations = irrelevant - however, how else would one determine irrelevant beyond motivation? >> 

* 31:00 - slide - 

* 36:00 - people think they argue about facts - true, but they also somehow have to argue about how to see the facts - and then, which interpretation is more valid when they are equally valid - perhaps which level of interpretation is most applicable, useful, and still relevant/correct - that is to say, valuable

* 39:00 - so if you orient yourself around goals, then where do the goals come from? - freud says the ID functions, primary goals/drives, a relatively rigid behavioural algorithm once the state has arisen -- peterson; that seems incorrect, as motivations are more than just states - rat maze example, scooting rat, running rat

* 42:00 - slide - chaos is all that you understand when you do not know what you are looking at - culture is in part what is outside of you, but it is also the framework of what you use to interpret the outside world - the downside of framing is that it partly isolates what you see - but good side of framing is then it lets you do something and be productive - in some sense, framing always oversimplifies things, one to compress to extent we can deal with it, another is because we need to get things done sooner than later << both limits are based on the resources available, except time, infinite time does not mean we delay everything >> 

* 44:00 - slide of walled city

* 45:00 - people have an infantile fear of death, so they turn to religion

* 00:00 - Psychoanalysis is engineering of people, as thus, requires philosophy

* 02:00 - Listening to others prevents you projecting your ideology onto them

* 03:00-06:00 - Eclectic psychologists are not as effective as strict adherents to one - perhaps if you pick and choose from every school of thought, you don't know any sufficiently, so are less effective - and also that if someone is coming to you because they are chaotic and confused, helping them to impose ANY structure is better than none, as none will have you flounder - Piagetian, you are going to be happier playing ANY game, than NO game - a part of maturation, is that it is very important for people to dedicate themselves to a SINGLE game, at the sacrifice of all the other things you could become, if you don't decide one thing, then you risk ageing chaotically, so you might as well age into something than becoming an old child, especially when they hit 40 it is almost irreparable at that point to become something as you have no decades of opportunity left and are people are less forgiving

* 06:00 - there are two expectations/obligations as a scientist (1) to use the scientific method (2) to come up with a measurement that is reliable and valid

* 10:25 - slide of personality - traits [frames of reference (modes of perception, patterns of behaviours, stable motivations, systems of values), sub-personalities]

* 11:00 - factor analysis and covariance, to find patterns of grouping in questions and answer results, to find covarying structures - big 5 is then 5 groups of covariance in the answers

* 11:00-16:00 - IQ

* 16:00 - does being around groups of people make you energetic or does it exhaust you? - introverts are exhausted by social interactions, extroverts are energised, you can be in the middle too

* 17:00 - your capacity to expand your ability past its initial constraints of your biological temperaments is something of the development of character/wisdom - if you are extroverted and learn to be introverted, it expands your domain of competence, and vice versa << perhaps, but it can also make you more unhappy and unfulfilled >> extroverts look at a field of people as interactions of possibilities, whereas introverts hope they are left alone - open people look at a field of people as opportunities to engage in interesting conversations (ideas and aesthetics) - neuroticism looks at the world as a place of threats that could hurt them

* 20:00 - personality traits set your goals - extroverts love parties and to tell jokes

* 21:30 - agreeable people define/segment the story of their life by the relationships they have

* 22:00 - the higher you value a particular trait, the more you value opportunities in that particular trait

* 24:00 - if you want a stable partner, one of the things you don't want in a relationship, is too much mismatch on the five fundamental dimensions

* 27:00 - industrious people cannot stand doing nothing, so they fill their time with action << perhaps why certain people cannot stand meditation, meditation doesn't seem a fit all be all >> - if you want to relax in your relationship, a conscientious person may not be a good choice

* 31:00 - slide

* 32:00 - if different personalities exist, then descriptive terms will get created to reflect the differences

* 36:00 - construct validation (how do you determine something exists) - a construct is a representation of something psychological that hypothetically exists objectively - how do you establish its existence objectively? does surprise exist? does joy exist? does guilt and shame exist? how do they all relate to each other? are they distinguishable? how do you measure them?

* 37:00 - politics is a place where self serving bias can enter the scientific arena

* 40:00 - founders institute

* 43:00 - IQ is required for anything complex - the thing about creative people, is they continuously step outside evaluation structures - the Lott of creative people is that they are always stepping outside evaluation structures, so can never feel or get the feedback they need to continue within structures

* 45:00 - science is powerful because it allows non-geniuses to figure out what the next question should be - however geniuses (super intelligent yet creative people) can blow the questions out of the water

* 46:00 - bureaucracies stultify because they get filled with conscientious people (and a few psychopaths), and the landscape shifts, even though they are going very productively (but now in the wrong direction) - which is why you always a need a few creative crazy people in your company because some of their ideas may just become true, and keep you relevant

* 47:00 - there is huge probability that your ideas and execution are valuable, but there is also extraordinary probability that it is not the right time and place for them - to be successful in the creative marketplace, you need great ideas, great people with skills you don't have, and then production of the product that is in demand by the marketplace that someone else hasn't done better - a creative person who isn't being creative, withers and dies, it is a jail sentence for them - if you want to have a creative career, you should have something stable on the side that earns money, and do your creative stuff on the side

* reality is not what we know, but what our perceptions tell us it is - reality cannot be what we know, as we can only observe reality from interactions, and know what those interactions produce, but not what unknown interactions produce

* 01:00 - clinical psychiatrists are trying to answer how to live properly, for themselves, and their clients, so philosophy as well as science are parts of that - philosophy as how to live properly is also about a values system

* 03:00 - you are surrounded by an infinite number of things to comprehend, but that isn't the world you live in, you live in a very constrained subset of those things, what is the nature of that subset, as that is what you inhabit and that makes up your experiences, and how is it related to the infinitely complex objects around you - you are in a perceptual/existential/phenomenological/qualia/desein frame

* 5:30 - slide - dasein - past and future are implicit in the current moment, we bring the past and the future, into our current actions and perceptions

* 08:00 - university entrance/denial letter, is a not just a piece of paper, that is a narrow perspective, it is a portal to your future, and your body knows that, as it shakes at that paper - your body is smarter than your eyes when it comes to perception, as it sees/includes more than just what your eyes see

* 09:45 - slide

* 10:00 - things interact with you, according to how you interact with them - every time you look at a masterpiece you get some different, as you are different, and it reflects different things back to you

* 13:00 - where does the book actually exist? it depends on how you define the book? << this seems to imply that there is organic living entity, a meme, that jumps from mind to mind, infecting them, through the body of books, words, and thoughts >>

* 13:30 - too sensitive, or too provocative - entangled dynamic between subjective perception and objective perception << my recent tweets actually communicate this

* 14:25 - slide - where you are, where you are going, your embodied actions

* 19:40 - slide - Meaning as primary: phainesthai - "what we perceive are 'first and foremost' not impression of taste, tone, smell or touch, not even things or objects, but meaning" — Binswanger L. (1963). Being in the World. New York: Basic Books, p. 114

* 19:45 - it has been said, that every person, is the exponent of some great philosopher's suppositions

* 20:00 - [WRONG: you see an object, you think about the object, you evaluate the objects, you decide how to act on the objects, and you act - object sense, perception, emotion, cognition, action] - what you see in the world is meanings; meaning detection first, object detection second - blindsight; show a angry face to a blind person, they see and react to the pattern, and the meaning of that pattern, even without object perception << a gene pattern creates a neuron pattern that recognises a perception pattern - a propagation of a pattern through patterns that at each instrument of propagation distills more meaning from noise >> << if objects were the reality, then how do books and video games and dialogue have so much impact and meaning to us, when their objects are nonsensical >> - science is the tearing of meaning away, to observe what is objective, true for all observers - but then you are left with no meaning << which is good for science, but not good for a belief system >> - you see the meaning first, then see the objects - baby glass table example, baby will not want to fall, sees a falling off place, despite glass being there

* 25:00 - what does it mean if you see the meaning first? that constitutes what you determine what is real - if you have evolved to see meaning, and it is what has kept you alive, then is there anything more real than the meaning?

* 26:35 - mad pen flipping skills

* 28:00 - slide - meaning as primary: phainesthai - "endowment of meaning; Binswanger: the revelation of exploration" you create the perception of beauty - "Disclosure of meaning: Boss: the revelation of the object" the beauty comes out to you from the object itself - you pursue the things that shine forth - the snitch in quidditch is a symbol of reality before it is fractionated into its parts, a symbol of what makes your curious - when you are curious about something, is it calling to you, or is something you are interpreting, Peterson says it is both - the thing that is to be perceived shines forth with its potential manifestations << this can be true if we consider reality separate from us, but wouldn't manifestation also be what we consider useful in the object, rather than what it considers useful about itself - a iron ore won't change into a skyscraper unless through human potential >>

* 32:00 - schizophrenia

* 40:50 slide of pipe, the representation/perception is not actually the thing, it is only your perception/representation of it << makes sense, as where does the boundaries of a human actually begin and end? are we creatures of society, is society part of us, what about all the organisms that live on us, and in us, and are part of us - to perceive humans as only human, is true from a social perspective, but not true entirely from a medical perspective, and so on >>

* 04:00 - because suffering is built into the human experience, psychopathology is an expected result, to the existentialist

* 06:00 - if someone is facing a problem, sometimes a correct label helps them discover it is not just their own suffering - it allows their calibration to be validated, that their suffering is calibrated, and they are not just neurotic

* 09:50 - slide from pascal 

* 17:10 - slide

* 21:30 - slide

* 22:00 - the few key concepts of psychotherapy - (1) you must enter into a willing relationship with your client, (2) exposure to fear voluntarily cures it

* 23:00 - cortisol administered involuntarily is destructive, when administered voluntarily, it is beneficial as it actives the circuits that dominate weakness

* 27:00 - the way the model is constituted represents your implicit assumptions about the situation

* 28:00 - we don't learn to be afraid, we learn to be calm - being afraid is our default state - being calm is a privilege state

* 29:00 - most animals brains are orientated around smell - the cat smell is a predator archetype to a rat, like a snake image is to us - our environment is an expansion of where we can live without dying

* 31:00 - a rat that is reminded that it is not safe, is not a fearful rat, you maintain your emotional stability by staying where you belong, a rat that has explored its environment is a calm rat - how the hell do you ever feel secure ever? part of the mystery of that is to never go anywhere where you'll feel upset, so you stay in your territory, where you know things are not dangerous, most of the time that will be correct, but sometimes it will not be - a psychometric point of view, you are calm and collected if your psyche is well organised, which is correct in some sense but there is more to it, you must turn yourself into a function being, in a functional landscape, and have concordance between yourself and your landscape to be a good fit for your society. The existentialists say, in the depths of your existential terror, the wisdom to cope in that terror will be found. The more behavioural the psychotherapy, the more implicit it is. Despite the fact that you are mismatched your existential complexity, there is something in you that is far more complex than you know. And if you challenge it, it will respond by growing and developing, and that will not protect you from the existential anxiety, it is not a shield that you can hide behind, it is not a defence, what happens instead is you actually learn how to deal with it.

* 35:00 - fire discussion - if you stress yourself properly, you incorporate more of the world, and you can master it, and it will transform your biologically structure - there's more to you than you know, and the way you bring it out, is by challenging yourself at the levels that you can manage

* 37:00 - existentialists were optimists despite their nihilism - humans are fundamentally week, but if we face our opponents, all sorts of possibilities manifest themselves, there it is not clear what the limits are for that - they make the strongest case possible for the vulnerability of human beings, as well as the strongest case possible for their strength and power

* 38:00 - **agoraphobia/acrophobias have a tendency to be women, and a tendency to seek authority when they are afraid - what they are afraid of is not having an authority to run to - it is not a good solution to the problem as recourse to authority can only take you so far - how you treat this, is what the rat does, you keep exploring your fear until you become bored with it, then you can feel calm in the face of that previous danger - you can look at the elevator without dying - find the edge between order and chaos, and creep closer to that boundary, when you hit it, realise you don't die, and do it long enough, you will get bored of it, after a few weeks of doing this, you push your boundaries more and more, to enlarge your are of perceived safety - the trick to this, is the patient must trust you, so you tell them and meant it, that we will stop doing this, whenever you want, as soon as you say so, this is completely up to you, I am not pushing you, I got no demands on you, you are not performing for me, this is not a test, this is not a contest, it is none of that, and when you are done, we are done**

* 43:00 - Freudian regression - a lot of the time people consciously know they can be safe, but they don't unconsciously know - part of them is thinking they are a 4 year old kid, they can't get out of there and nobody will listen to them - people can turn into a children very easily 

* 44:00 -** agoraphobia/acrophobia - she would never risk upsetting authority, as if she upset authority, then it would expose her to the world** - if you just treat the elevator fear, then it will just pop up somewhere else, that is symbolic substitution, but that isn't always what happens, if they are more likely to enter into an elevator, then they are more likely to take a taxi - it's because they weren't learning that things are less frightening, they were learning *counterconditioning*, basically the person has been afraid of whatever it was, and you put them in face of that and let them breathe and relax, but it wasn't that, so then you think it was* fear reduction and habituation*, which is when you learn to ignore, but it wasn't that, what it actually was is you teach them for the first time how to be brave, before they just thought of themselves as pathetic and fear ridden and tiny and vulnerable and useless, so they are acting like that, and you help them with one fear, and they realise, wow I can do that, I'm not as useless as I thought, and then they have the courage to try new things, and they make many more small improvements, that reinforce their abilities to take on the world more - they may even stand up to a family member, which may encounter psychotherapeutic resistance from a family member, which is something you need to ask the family members, do you really want your partner to be better, a little more assertive, and a little less fearful, you might not be able to tyrannise over them as easily - and the patient may not be happy about that, as they may be getting a lot of secondary benefits for being neurotic and martyred, as that is a vicious weapon to be weak and useless, if you can wield that as a weapon, it is extraordinarily effective

* 48:00 - slide - :in many ways [existentialism] is the unique and specific portrayal of the psychological predicament of contemporary man..." May, R. Existence: Origins of the Existential Movement - this is that modern people have been stripped of their archaic belief systems are exposed more completely to the possibility of a meaningless and painful existence with no superordinate meaning

* 48:26 - slide - existentialism is not a school of thought nor reducible to any set of tenets. The three writers who appear invariably on every list of existentialists - Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre - are not in agreement on essentials. Such alleged precursors as Pascal and Kierkegaard differed from all three men by being dedicated Christians; and Pascal was a Catholic of sorts, while Kierkegaard was a Protestant's Protestant. If, as is often done, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky are included in the fold, we must make room for an impassioned anti-Christian and even more fanatical Greek-Orthodox Russian imperialist. **By the time we consider adding Rilke, Kafka, Ortega, and Camus, it becomes plain that one essential feature shared by all these men is their ****_perfervid_**** individualism. The refusal to belong to any school of thought, the repudiation of the adequacy of any body of beliefs whatever, and  and especially of systems, and a marked dissatisfaction with traditional philosophy as superficial, academic, and remote from life - that is the heart of existentialism. **- that is another element of individualism, the locale of action is in the individual, you are fated in some sense to suffer and to be an individual, so the right level of analysis is at the individual, which is a primary tenant of individual psychotherapy

* 51:00 - self authoring program,** eliminates the assumption that weaker performance is can only be rectified by sociopolitical interventions, and not individual psyche interventions **- women outperform men by a long margin in academia now, this program repairs that, everyone improves, but the men jump ahead of the women afterwards, despite the improvements to the women - the hypothesis here, that men are **_ornery_** enough, that unless men have their own plan, they will not perform, this seems associated to their disagreeableness

* 54:00 - << the more people talk about themselves, the more it turns from a dodgy essay full of contradictions into a coherent integrated story - perhaps this is why self authoring works - perhaps this is why women are more integrated than men these days, as women talk about themselves a lot >>

* 1:09:08 - if two set of conclusions can be drawn from the same experience, then you cannot say it was the experience that drew the conclusion, that is dishonest, it was you who chose to draw the conclusion that you preferred

* 1:09:27 - slide

* 1:10:00 - the fact that one thing can collapse on you, indicates that anything can collapse on you, and can make you completely unwilling to manifest faith in anything whatsoever - and that is the emergence of nihilism

* 1:11:00 - slide - the life now, not later, is so rife with suffering, that it needs to be addressed now, and promising an afterlife is not sufficient explanation to do away with the need to rectify that suffering

* 1:12:00 - no goal or value structure, no positive emotion - it is easy to get rid of positive emotion - try to get rid of your negative emotion instead, good luck, that is not going to happen - so what happens, is if your value system collapses, then all you are left is negative emotion - people then flee to totalitarian certainty over nihilistic chaos

* 20:00 - exercise is the best thing to keep declining IQs intact

* 22:00 - integrated emotions is when your actions and your emotions are heading in the same direction - people who have problems are afraid of the problems, and that is an antagonistic force keeping a part of them in a different direction that the rest - you should ask them "what would your life be like if you didn't have this problem?" if you think it through, 3-5 years of consequences, then you will be less afraid of facing it - that way, instead of your anxiety being a dragon in front of you, it is a dragon behind you chasing you down the path of resolution

* 23:00 - really, the number one reason people come to psychotherapy is because they are too agreeable << this correlates with my thoughts, that the self-development/personal-development/therapy/counselling scene has been invaded with help for agreeable types, by mostly agreeable types - with little advice for disagreeable/masculine people - and they don't realise this is even occurring or an issue - despite male mental high snowballing >> when you are doing assertiveness training, you find out what they are angry about, it will often make them cry many times, and get them to envision what they want instead (as they are afraid to think about this, because it is painful as it makes them realise they don't have it << or the costs/damage that it could cause >>) - then have them build a strategy, that will give them options, so they are not powerless, power comes with options 

* 27:00 - underground emotions make you age quicker - anger is linked to cardiovascular detriment

* 28:30 - cognitive dissonance - once you get your mind and your emotions working correctly, then you must act them out consistently - then you erase the distinction between yourself and the world... this one is tough - someone's house, is their mind - if you want to organise your mind, organise your room

    * << interesting, as I've been attracted to girls with really really messy rooms before... is this because I am wanting to play with fire, invite some chaos into a life that is too ordinary - other times, I've been attracted to girls who have very tidy and organised rooms, and thus lives >>

    * why even bother improving yourself? because then you and others don't have to suffer as much

    * if you are in pain, you care - pain is one of those things, that brings the idea that if it didn't exist, things would be better

    * if you are to consider the expanse of your existence << your environment >> and find ways to improve that, then you will naturally by extension improve yourself - fix the things you go through each day, fix the mundane, as they are the most important things you do

    * once you solve your dissonance, you and the world align to accomplish your aim, and that is because you see what you aim at

    * explicit axiomatic preconditions

        * assuming a minimal mutual willingness to be in contact and to receive communications,

        * we may say that the greater the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behaviour on the part of one individual,

        * the more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency toward reciprocal communication with the same qualities,

    * mutually accurate understanding of the communications, improved psychological adjustment and functioning in both parties,

    * and mutual satisfaction in the relationship

* 41:00 - if you tell people things they don't know, it may hurt them, but they won't be as stupid and won't run into nearly as many painful things

* 43:00 - if your relationship/friendship is not therapeutic then it is not a relationship, it is a disorder

* 46:00 - if you are having a conversation with someone, and it is boring - it is because you're stupid, because you aren't listening to them, if you listen to them properly, they will tell you the weirdest things

* 47:00 - if you are not going into a conversation to learn and become a better person, then what are you going into for, as there is nothing better than that - the agenda of a conversation should be "we want to move forward, with your and mine best interests in mind"

* 48:00 slide

    * we know from our research that such empathic understanding - understanding with a person, not about him, - is such an effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality.

    * some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people, and that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great indeed that you're listening has not been of the type I have described.

    * fortunately I can suggest a little laboratory experiment which you can try to test the quality of your understanding

        *  the next time you get into an argument with your wife, or your friend, or with a small group of friends, just stop the discussion for a moment and for an experiment, institute this rule

        * you see what this would mean

* 04:00 - not just one mind, we have sub-personalities - if we had one mind, we would be able to control it - if you are hungry, you are nothing but hunger - if you are angry, you are nothing but anger

* 08:30, 9:40 - slide - book - the discovery of the unconscious (freud, jung, adler)

* 10:20 - slide

* 10:30 - women on birth control are essentially biologically different creates - ovulation and attractiveness, and how birth control stuffs it up <<[ http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/08/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-and-crazy/](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/08/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-and-crazy/) 

* 12:45 - modern people like to fantasise that there is nothing dangerous about sex, but that is ridiculous, because everything about it is dangerous

* 14:00 - back in the victorian period, the repression was a lot about prevention of unwanted pregnancy, and unwanted disease - people were incredibly poor, the average person lived on <$1/day (modern $1)

* 14:55 - slide

* 15:15 - slide - four forms of consciousness - conservative; the unconscious stores memories, unaccessible to voluntary recall. dissolutive; the unconscious contains habits, once voluntary, now automatized, and dissociated elements of the personality, which may lead a "parasitic existence". creative: the unconscious services as the matrix of new ideas. mythopoetic: the unconscious constructs narratives and fantasies that appear mythic or religious in nature.

* 16:00 - types of memories that we repress - no point in pain without utility

* 17:00 - arguments and memory

* 19:00 - what is meaningful, is something that alters our future path in a trivial or more way

* 22:30 - dreams are strange, as we observe them, rather than produce them with a conscious effort

* 24:00 - the less integrated you are, the less control you have over your sub-personalities, and prone to disorders - in healthy development, the piagetian model is correct - in unhealthy development, the freudian model is correct

* 26:00 - superego is what is tyrannical, and lords over you with judgements - anorexia is a form of an out of control superego

* 28:40 - slide  - idea/emotion as pathogen

* 33:00 - doubt as a sub-personality, and when a sub-personality is unleashed, it becomes a complex (when a whole series of unprocessed experiences come together to overtake you)

* 35:00 - 1/3 of first year university of Toronto students pass the "hospitalised depression" criteria

* 36:00 - strokes in the right hemisphere, they can forget their left side even exists, it isn't so much neglect but unawareness

* 39:00 - slide of defence mechanisms; repression (if you don't like it, lie about it - especially to yourself), denial (the truth isn't so bad), reaction formation (I really really really really love my sister), displacement (my boss yells at me, I yell at my husband, my husband yells at the baby, the baby bites the cat)

* 39:52 - slide of defence mechanisms, continued; identification (I want to be the bully), rationalisation (we all know what this means), intellectualisation (woody allen), sublimation (ok then, I'll sculpt naked women), project (it's not me, it's you)

* 41:00 - slide of neurotic manifestations; "unconscious ideas are at the core of psychological conflicts; incomprehensible distress, psychosomatic symptoms, behavioural anomalies, hallucinations and delusions

* 46:00 - slide on jokes - jokes allow for the expression of repressed wishes and ideas. for example, the Jester, or medieval court fool, was often the only individual in the kingdom who was allowed to tell the truth to the king. Jokes express in playful language what culture will not allow formally expressed. It is a relief for someone to communicate something of which the repression of it tires you.

* 47:00 - jung and freud believed dreams were trying to communicate repressed desires, in the best way they could (even through twists and knots so you can deal with it gently, or as direct as its ability of communication could allow)

* 00:00->22:00 - WOW

* 29:00 - unless you are willing to be a fool, you will never perfect anything - you are a fool as you try something new, but you will remain a fool if you don't try - you must know you are inevitably infallible in order to improve - to write a book, write a very bad first draft, and then it gets better - to get better, you must put yourself out into the domain of the unknown to begin with

* 32:00 - places high in contamination, also become high in disgust and order in order to counteract the contamination

* 34:00 - disgust is not fear, hitler discussion - the most unhappy people are liberal men

* 37:00 - conscientious people are very high in will-power

* 40:00 - intelligence and totalitarianism 

* 46:00 - heroes growing up outside of the culture is a common motif << could this also be the hero who runs from their problem can also become strong enough to eventually confront them? >>

* 49:00 - when the wise king doesn't pay attention, the malevolent king takes control << true from the state level, and the individual level, as we and you avoid looking at things we don't want to look at >>

* 51:00 - when you leave a kingdom, you will always end up in a desert/disorder/no-sanitation - when a state loses order, it dissolves into a desert chaos << fascinating, as when simba first arrives, he nearly dies in the desert and struggles, but when he is ready now to claim his kingship, he runs through it - this would indicate that he has now conquered the narrative and is now strong (the hero story narrative video)

* WOW

* 1:00 - lion king influenced by archetypes, marvel comics the stories are co-created by writers and readers

* 2:00 - book, jung

* ~8:00 - motivation forces compose your fantasies

* 10:00 - when things rationally don't make sense, you must ask yourself, in what metaphorical context do they make sense

* 10:30 - sun is the hero that illuminates the sky and the day, it would then wrestle with the darkness and the demons during night and come out victorious each day

* 11:00 - we say we are enlightened when we learn something new, not that we are endarkened - this seems socio-biologically grounded in us, rather than something rational

* 11:30 - how do we comport ourselves during the day, during the journey of the day - this is the fundamental question - then at night we battle the demons in our unconsciousness

* 12:00 - dreams seem to compress knowledge to find the essence of learning, and encode it into your unconscious << this is really interesting, from a metaphysical/mythological perspective

* 14:30 - rock represents the solid aspects of tradition, it is where we inscribe our learnings, and it is the best thing for staying constant through time

* 19:00 - serotonin governs posture - when one integrates their shadow, gets the aggressive part of themselves as a controlled tool, they stop being a dear in a headlights (everything coming in, and nothing coming out) - the people who are too agreeable will look childlike and innocent, the people who are too disagreeable will look hardened and cruel - people who are integrated judge the world while also interacting with it

* 21:00 - jungian self is the potential of yourself across time - we incorporate information and experiences to grow anew intellectually and biologically and genetically

* 22:00 - pilgrimages grow you by integrating new experiences and knowledge into you - you go to all the corners of the world to find your "self" - that accomplishment of your potential

* 25:00 - agreeable people respond with maternity to cute stimulus

* 29:00 - witnessing a master, master the meta-game, appeals to us innately, as it is a testament to the human spirit that surges through all of us

* 31:00 - the king always has an evil bother, that is to say, the state always has a tyrannical element - that is because the state deteriorates of its own accord (it is a construction of the past), as the state mismatches the past with the present it becomes malfunctioning, so the tyranny keeps it alive and updated - floods can occur when we look the other way, or our systems are out of date - so keep confronting what you don't want to look and keep your internal systems/representations up to date, and look at what you need to in order to prosper and sort things out

* 34:00 - milton, paradise lost

* 34:00 - the problem with rationality, is that it tends to fall in love with its own creations - it is authoritarian - the left hemisphere imposes a coherent structure, and the right hemisphere will keep it updated with the integration of fantasy

* 38:00 - cats when put in a new place will seek out every place they can hide, and leverage, and potential spots of danger

* 41:00 - if you go outside what you know, it will cause a fall, as it is beyond you - the hero is the one who falls and gets back up, which is to say, they push their boundaries, learn how they fell, and become stronger each time, incorporating new experiences/knowledge into their self, growing into a better hero

* 43:00 - all positive emotion and enthusiasm gets taken advantage of - pedophiles take advantage of trust systems (the innate trust of children) to take advantage of them

* 44:00 - jungian anima, the feminine counterpart in the soul << I've certainly experienced this with certain relationships before >>

* 45:00 - don't confuse your privilege with competence, which is what you all do, it is a false arrogance, as you have no idea in the ways society protects you

* 47:00 - curiosity << blue velvet - biological necessity for curiosity is interesting >>

## @balupton

* 03:25 - slide - Jean Piaget - the fact that facts change seems to indicate that they are not so self-evidently facts - 

* 06:00 - infants would develop low-resolution tools on how to process and operate in the world - and as they grow, they develop new higher-resolution theories/tools that they can switch between in the appropriate contexts to produce the most-applicable results << the "victim/perpetrator power" complex, is such a low-resolution infantile conception of the world

* 11:08 - slide

* 12:00 - if an anomaly occurs, it is either a problem with your model of the world, or a problem with the world, although good luck with that latter option (you vs the world) << this seems a beautiful romantic aspect of science, it is about refining our models of the world for the anomalies that occur (encountering dragons, defeating them, and spreading the knowledge with the world to refine our models) >>

* 14:55 - slide - a better tool, does what the old tool does, and covers more additional things << seems a simplification, as a pocket knife isn't better than a machete when it comes to cutting jungle >>

* 17:31 - slide - procedural/mechanical memory (how to drive - built into your muscles), vs representational/episodic memory (built into your memory/stories) - the contents of procedural memory precedes the contents of representational memory - you start as an infant building your procedural memory, that is in part why as you don't remember anything of your infancy

* 23:00 - **games and moral development, emergent morality** - the games children plays transform ... into the games that adult plays - people start playing games unconsciously and interactively, and eventually they start playing games intellectually

* 25:32 - slide

* 31:00 - slide - you might have to think about what upset you for 6 months before you figure out why something actually upset you - you often only detect your norms once they are violated, as why bother focusing on something that is working - it is almost the definition of something that is working, that you don't need to focus on it, you can just operate with a low-resolution representation of it instead - only when it breaks (or rather doesn't do what you functionally set out for it to do) then you need to debug it through the process of turning your low-resolution representation of it into a high-resolution representation to figure out what went wrong and how to resolve it, then once solved, you can put back the low-resolution representation and focus on other things to get other things done

* **_34:00 - watch the minute surrounding this, and comment on it later - is about parenting protecting children_** - you are incomplete, and society fills in the gaps

* 38:00 - the more upset you get about something, the more fundamental something is to your existence - **crying patients in psychotherapy,** occurs when something occurs when something is beyond their emotional abilities - writing about emotional events helps you overcome them, writing about how you overcome emotional events even helps to overcome the meta-problems

* 41:00 - slide - we get annoyed by irrelevant facts, as they are infinitely useless

* 43:00 - mouse - danger or not danger - children learn often by reference, when something unknown occurs, they watch it, and also watch for what society does (what the parent does) to understand from wiser people how to interpret the anomaly, for how to categorise it, and how to act according to it - don't look at the objective world and infer meaning, as it could be exactly opposite, and often it is, where what you have inferred is what you see - a good tennis player is a person who has accurate predictive models of the stances of their opponent in relation to prior ball movements (not someone with impossible reaction times for the way the ball is currently moving) - what remains constant among transformations appears to be fact

# [2017 Personality #4-5](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-4-5/52/1)

## @balupton

* 06:00 - you need commonalities, otherwise you need to explain everything - humans have many commonalities, hence why we don't need to explain many predicates of being human (love, anger, jealousy, etc) - those who act out the roles as the victor in those standard narratives, are those who become the victors in life - participating in these meta-narratives drive success 

* 20:00 - martial arts - we train you not to be cruel, but how to be cruel when you need to be cruel - that is strength

* 21:00 - the human shadow is all the things about yourself that you don't want to realise - which is your own gateway to hell - and when encountered, it is very difficult to keep under control

* 22:00 - wisdom is not achieved through happiness, it is from facing the things you least want to face

* 23:00 - the knights of the round table, to find the holy grail, they each went into the corner of the forest that each considered darkest

* 23:00 - things of you are underdeveloped because they haven't been given the attention they need to grow, because you don't want to look at them, because you don't want to acknowledge them

* 23:00 - approximations of the unifying story within each of us, is the mythical, and the more perfect of an abstraction, the less relatable it becomes, as it removes the flaws of ourselves, which is the precondition of the human being, as the flaws connect our individual experience to the mythical experiences of others

* 26:00 - you can tell an evil tyrant story about a culture easy, but it forgets all the good, and is stemmed from lack of gratitude and resentment, and is ignorant

* 27:00 - peter pan

* 29:00 - potential sacrifices itself if not used in time - who the hell wants a 40 year-old embodying a 6-year-old so you might as well become flawed but actualised potential, rather than avoiding it all together

* 30:00 - informers in soviet russia, lenin -> stalin, the tyrannical element of the great father (old-testament god)

* 38:00 - fascinated by the unknown

    * << perhaps by mystery - blue velvet is like this, with the affair, and his intoxication with the mystery, then when it becomes too much (he gets bitten), he gets the appropriate help >>

    * the predator is the destructive aspects of the other tribe, the worst of all predators, is the human capacity for evil, at which point we conceptualise danger into something psychological

    * one of the things humans had to figure out, was how to face danger, then we figured out how to abstract it into a meta category of dangerous things, then we could solve them all at once

    * the hero story, is when a community is threatened by an old evil, and a knight comes along and chases the evil, and on his way he has adventures that transforms him from useless and naive into a hero, and slays the dragon, and comes back transformed and shared what he learned with the community 

* 44:00 - simba was the king of everything that the light touches, and where the darkness was were danger and chaos existed, simba confronted the chaos but got bitten and required the protection of society to bail him out, but then society failed, and chaos took over, and he had to strengthen up

* 45:00 - curiosity wins over forbidden fruits

* 52:32 - slide of the unknown - nature, the great mother, the object to be fertilised

* 55:40 - slide of hell

* 55:00 - we all have a sense of what is wrong in our lives, it is better to correct it early, before it becomes something that knocks you out for 4 years

* 56:00 - the word "down" is archetypical

* 57:13 - slide of threat itself (kelly) - how to do deal with threat, what is the best way to be in the world to deal with threat, to deal with something, you gotta be able to conceptualise it

* 1:00:00 - sacrifice is sacrificing today's pleasures for tomorrow's advantage - you have to give threat what it wants, otherwise it will crush you if you don't, and if you do, it will smile on you, and you'll have a good life - we discovered the future, and it was a place you can bargain with, how do you bargain with the future? you give it what it wants - if you make the right sacrifices, kelly/threat/storm turns into mother nature and nurtures you

* 1:03:00 - slide of known and unknown, ying and yang - what you know can turn into what you don't know instantaneously - etc. when your dreams fall apart, or someone dies, etc

* 1:06:00 - you bite off as much as you can chew, but nothing more - and you will strengthen what builds the world, as you live on the edge between chaos and structure, and can mend them together with communication - the brain hemisphere's do this

* 1:10:00 - we are adapted to the meta-reality, that which remains constant across the spans of time

    * << it makes me think that things like yin-yang, external realities, are all tied to Darwinian themes, that we couldn't come up with yin-yang, if there wasn't a biological driver for it… >>

* 1:12:21 - exploring is combination of conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion - you are optimally balanced when you are listening to an interesting conversation, because both of what you know is changing - or when you are listening to a piece of music, that transforms just the right amount from chaos and order, and with a narrative of a particular emotion or theme or other meaning

* 1:15:00 - it is through fantasy that we first encounter the unknown - "animas" is what a man projects onto a woman he finds desirable - marriage - **_anima - feminine, animus - masculine _**

* 1:18:00 - openness is a like a tree, and your most prominent aspects is your most lively trunk - and if you are a creative person, and you are not creating, you are dying

* 1:24:00 - you have to be brutal to be useful in the face of your parents death (the death of the culture that raised you)

    * << Janusz Korwin-Mikke >>

    * do you want to be useful in the face of tragedy, or do you want to be pathetic

* 1:26:44 - slide of the knower and the sun

* 1:27:48 - slide of the masculine/paternal and feminine/maternal

    * << feminists aren't just denigrating the maternal, they are trying to bring the maternal into the workplace to treat adults as children, rather than having their own children they take care of >>

* 1:28:35 - slide of horus and seth

* **_1:44:00 - _****what could you do? - that is a leading question, it implies there is something you can do to change the situation** **- he has strengthened himself and his character - it leads change - it construes yourself as that which can prevail**

* 1:45:00 - Lecture 5

* 1:45:00 - You have to be awake if you are anxious. Anxiety makes you alert.

* 1:49:00 - Human beings because they discovered the future - a big mistake, as the future is an uncertain place - we realise there isn't any threat right now, but there may be some tomorrow or next year, but it is coming! - out of the category of danger, emerges different threats, and the dragon is a symbol of the ever-present threat of physical-and-meta predators

* 1:52:00 - nature initialises women by and in of itself, society must initiate men - in a cave, you must conquer the demons in your own imagination - to recast them, and put yourself back together - the first step to individualisation, the discovery of yourself, is to accept your shadow, it is how you are attached to the archetype of evil - most people these days are so damn naive they can't even comprehend actual evil

* 1:56:00 - there isn't perpetrators and victims - the horror and noble elements of humanity are all aspects of your being - the pathway to making yourself better, is the pathway through your own internal hell - if you are resentful about something, it means you need to either grow the hell up and accept your responsibility, or you are oppressed and you have something to say or do to free yourself from oppression - it is easier to just not to say anything, it protects you in the short term, but it can crush you, and turn into revenge

* 1:58:00 - shooting kids in schools

    * << or bashing perceived ideological opponents unconscious in antifa rallies >>

* 1:59:00 - you should go after the unknown, you shouldn't protect what you know, you already know what you know, you must talk with people you disagree with, as otherwise it will keep you stupid, and if you are not wise, the world will wallop you more than it has to - and you will be against the walloping - you must step forward, and go after it early when it is still manageable, during the initial stages of that bullying, when it is still in its developing stages - you must be ready to speak and say what you have to say, on a moments notice - if we make mistakes once, we can write it off as people make mistakes, if it happens a second time, take notice, if it happens a third time, take action

* 2:02:00 - constructivism

    * << seems reasonable >>

* 2:05:00 - people see only slices of other people, as they cannot possibly see everything

    * << buddhist practice of seeing people dead, or without skin >>

* 2:06:00 - psychoanalysts break overwhelming big problems that you are afraid of, into micro-problems that you have a reasonable chance of getting over

* 2:11:00

    * << you should aim to be bored of that which offends you, as then you are not afraid of it, and you can move past it to more productive things >>

* 2:13:00

    * << they cower behind code of conducts that protect their adolescence >>

    * you are not as much of a rabbit as you think, you help them grow some teeth, so they can have that fight with their husband that they should have had 20 years ago

    * abusers will marry those which are afraid of their own shadow, as it means they will never leave

    * you don't make someone less afraid, you make them braver - brave is alert and able to cope, naive is there is no danger

* 2:16:00

    * << merlin; you must be brave against your shadow to control it appropriately, to be scared of your shadow it will control you to become a tyrant >>

    * too damn useless to be attractive to anyone, if everyone rejects you, there is probably something deeply wrong that will be very difficult to address

* 2:20:00 - there is a category of "problems in life" and that category will never go away, so you need to be able to deal with the entire category, so be able to deal with its problems at the same time, and withstand - otherwise you will fall

* **_2:21:00 - if your ancestors were stupid, we wouldn't be here!_** - they lived under harsher conditions than we do, back then, we would have lasted 15 minutes, you don't want to be thinking of your ancestors as stupid

* 2:21:00 - you make sacrifices in the present so the future is better - you can bargain with reality, you can forestall gratification now, and it will pay off in a time that doesn't even exist yet

* 2:23:00 - I'm not a fan of moral relativism, partly because I think it is an extreme form of cowardice

* 2:26:09 - slide

* 2:26:20 - slide

* 2:26:35 - when you go into psychotherapy…

    * << you are a hero when you grasp the moral of the story in a way that prevents it from happening again >>

* 2:29:21 - slide

* 2:29:47 - when something bad happens to you, you must take a journey into your domains of morality - often with psychedelic substances - john hopkins... 1 standard deviation higher in openness

* 10:30 - most important question in life is not "what is the world made of?" but "how to act in the world?"

* 32:00 - the mythical underworld is where you go when things fall apart, such as procrastination, it is a state of being - what are you afraid of, what are you failing to develop, how can you get over it, how can you reclaim those parts of yourself

* 38:00 - punished for your virtues is a typical story

* 39:00 - humanities should make you more than the child of your parents, it should also make you the child of your culture, to become a well-rounded adult

* 40:00 - as life is so difficult, you must do something truly worthwhile to justify it - you have an ethical duty to straighten things out, and if you don't do it, you will suffer - story of jonas, and saint patrick, saint george

* 41:00 - jungian idea - part of development is to understand your shadow - the shadow of the parts of you, that you don't want to own up to or face - you cannot have proper respect for yourself unless recognise you are a monster

    * << this probably applies to organisation, scheduling, and planning - keeping the shadow of your procrastination under control by your better self, because you know you are a fallible dopamine addict >>

* 44:30 - medusa, prey animal response freezes us to threats - facing your fears voluntarily is your best bet if you want to survive, but it is not easy, and many people fall under, get bit, and die - but to not face your fears, you will go under and you will die - as you won't stand a chance, you are coward of your own shadow, a slave to it

* 1:09:00 - your attention is autonomous

* 1:30:00 - being at the top of the dominance hierarchy regulates your emotions (happy things make you more happy, sad things don't affect you as much) - being at the bottom of one, makes things affect you worse, and you perceive the world as more chaotic as you don't understand its games, nor how to play in them

* 5:30 - the difference between unhappiness and happiness is a very difficult distinguishment, as there is so much involved

* 10:00 - knowledge is information that can be applied in life, memorisation doesn't bring application, wisdom is when to apply

* 13:00 - negative emotions cluster together, such that you experience one, you are likely to experience others - neuroticism is the likelihood to experience such clustering

* 13:30 - agreeableness - self sacrificing, polite, compassionate - they do not like conflict, they care for other people - they put others concerns above their own

* 14:30 - conscientiousness - diligent, industrious, orderly

* 16:00 - extrovert sees the world as a place of social opportunity - introvert sees the world as a place to retreat from and spend time alone

* 16:30 - you have to hope you are born in an era that actually has a niche for your particular temperaments -** surviving personalities seem to be propagated by the needs of society**

* 18:30 - conscientiousness responds with disgust to mess, all they want is to straighten it out and clean it

* 22:00 - study, sleep, study, sleep - best for integration and memory - as well as summarising - practice remembering, will help you with recall memory

* **24:00 - creative/achievement questionnaire**

* 25:00 - as you get older, you've traded youth for money

* 25:30 - you can thrive when your personality, and personal proclivities**, match the environment you live in**

* 26:00 - is your child more a part of you than your arm? mothers certainly act that way

* 27:30 - you can look at someone unhappy, and believe that is a problem with the way they are seeing the world - or it could be accurate - sometimes the fundamental problem with the client is not the client, but their environment

* 29:00 - proclivities for socialness also gives us a proclivity to become entangled in social pathologies

* 32:00 - you learn from voluntary contact with that which frightens or disgusts you - from filth wisdom is found - the psychoanalysis process is the process of digging up old skeletons, and many other bad things, to deal with them and learn from them, so they can be cleaned out - when you get what you want, you feel better, as your manner of dealing with the world is correct - when you don't get what you want, your manner of dealing with the world / conceptualisation of the situation, is inaccurate

* 37:00 - one of things you do as clinician, is find out what they are avoiding, break it down into pieces they can deal with, to assist them with mastery of the things they got stuck down with, as to help them form increased freedom of movement in the future down the path they desire - character and personality are the most important things to develop and sophisticate as they are the most crucial things in your life to your success

* **40:00 - read as if it matters! as if it is about you! and tools for you to use!**

* 41:00 - we are not yet in psychology educated enough to map treatment to temperament** << opportunity >>**

* **42:00 - two things we all need to know  - what the world is made of, and how to act in it**

* **49:00 - good problem solving questions**

## @balupton

* 00:00 - you can access being from what exists (the scientific process - the stripping off of the subjective from the phenomena), and from how to exist?

* 11:00 - the way out of moral relativism, is to be able to estimate and contrast (measure) belief systems against each other

* 27:00 - the games that are played voluntarily win out over the games that are played through tyranny << open-source? business? the SJW postmodernism rights conquest? virtual-reality/augmented-reality porn/relationships/adventures - soylent with vr headsets with solar panels) >>

* 37:00 - to test a universal theory, evaluate it against every level of analysis you can, and if it passes every one, the more likely it is universally true - but you must also try to disprove them, by evaluating them in areas that are independent from the original frame of thinking << wouldn't this be attempting to create a chimera though? in the way the feminist literature does >>

* 41:00 - people don't have goals, they have nested hierarchies of goals - they have micro goals that have macro goals - it all depends on the frame of reference - what happens when you make a mistake? you will encounter a stimuli that punishes you - the problem with an error, is you don’t know what the error signifies

* 1:00:00 - when you collapse into chaos, your positive emotion systems shut down 

* 1:01:00 - an error has come about, that has blown their frames of reference out, and they stay blown out - a nihilistic solution, a collapse

* 1:07:00 - don't let your children do anything that lets you dislike them (also don’t be an idiot, your partner needs to tell you when your demands on the child is excessive) + it is up to you, to make them chose a path, that makes them someone who you want to be around (as that will help make them people that society want to be around) - the problem of a child is to raise them as a citizen of a collaborative social world - you have a responsibility to those you love, and are obligated to and to yourself, to make sure that they manifest themselves in which is most beneficial to them in the long run, you help each other how not to make each other make fools of yourselves in public

* 1:10:00 - if you decide not to make a stand, you weaken yourself and you make your enemy stronger - the longer you leave it, the bigger the monster grows - if you interact with the monster, you unpack it, and you learn, so you can get stronger and the enemy is more understood - don't lose an opportunity to grapple with something that objects to you, especially when the objection is rather small - rule of 3, if you do something that I find disruptive, and it occurs 3 times, then I will confront you - I’m not ignoring it and we can get to the bottom of it - you push away the objections 3 times, they get mad and they burst into tears, and you push that aside, then you can solve the problem as you’ve gotten to the depth of it - not be intimidated by anger, and not to be swamped by compassion by the tears

* 1:20:00 -** if you continue to be a slave, you will continue to produce tyrants - your normative morality, your harmlessness and naivety masquerading as virtue, is completely insufficient to protect you in the world - tyrants will push until someone pushes back** << when you encounter psychopathic traits, they will continue to get stronger and suck more people into their abuse of trust networks, unless you confront the problematic behaviour instantly, otherwise a bed of a thousand knives will emerge and conquer/dominate the system >>

* 1:25:00 - if you are unhappy despite what you have, you may have to let go all that you have, to open the void to finding the things that you were lacking - **you should let go of anything interfering with your psychological progression, as however valuable what you have is it is still not as valuable as what you are giving up!**

* 1:32:00 - attachment is not necessarily bad, it is bad when you can't let something go that you need to when the time comes to

* 1:33:00 - is the less radical solution to the problem, that crucifixion and resurrection

* 1:34:00 - you should conceptualise the highest possible good you can, and then orientate yourself around that, then act in the moment - pinocchio story parallels with god and human creation story << conflation in society of creator is perfect and created a perfect creation - any programmer knows this is a ridiculous concept - the creator is closer to perfection, but is imperfect, and does his best, and creates his best, but never perfect - the creation is transcendental, but unfamiliar with the human condition of entropy - whereas the creator is less transcendental as time passes, but familiar with battle scars of the human condition - so they work together, the creation to renew the creator's world, and the creator to protect the creation from the evils and to blossom into something worthy and influential >>

* 1:38:55 - slide

* 1:43:00 - if your life isn't how you want it to be, then you need to find the thing that you are most afraid, and confront it, in order to move past the thing holding back and bring about the change that you need - so what are you afraid of?

* 1:46:00 - generally speaking, the route to optimal living, has already been laid out by those who has preceded us

* 1:55:00 - the role of maturation is to be able to instil the aspects of childhood as a matured man, not to stay in childhood that is peter pan

* 1:56:00 - if you don't have your own sense of meaning, then you will fall into prey from tyrannical belief systems, as they will offer you the meaning that you should already have

* 1:57:00 - sometimes you won't have an answer that works, but only an answer that is the best bet of producing the desired result

* 1:58:00 - **sometimes you won't know what is the best possible outcome, so you can say what you think, and then define that as the best possible outcome** - it is very infrequently in life that you know the best outcomes, and the best ways to get there - there is no certainty in life, but this seems the best possible solution - if you pursue the things that give you meaning in life, even though they are difficult, then will have a greater chance of conquering the chaos and redeeming the reward - the phenomena of meaning manifests itself at the locale of optimal challenge - you need the optimisation of engagement and meaning - **you pick your level of tooling (the layer of meaning hierarchy that you wish to challenge) that optimises your level to be engaged in it** - as that will improve your journey of improving imperfections - becoming the best at becoming better

* 2:06:00 - a little knowledge of death destroys you - full voluntary acceptance of death, is the cure

* 2:07:00 - cain externalised responsibility of his life - **you don't take responsibility of the things you don’t accept, you only take responsibility of things you chose to accept - accept responsibility of the catastrophe of your life, you are strong enough to do that, once you do it, you only find that out once you do actually go and do it - you must be willing to lose your life in order to find it** - buddha by accepting that life is suffering, he has transcended his suffering - **don’t let what you are stop you from being what you could be** - if you identify with what you are, then you are a tyrant - if you identify with chaos/what you could be, then you’re nihilistic - identify with the capacity to continuously transform what you are << you require the continuity of the narrative of your path to your future in order to have the correct foundations of how they tie together, otherwise you have just created anew without learning anything - a different game each time, without ever learning from the last >>

* 2:10:00 - you want to find out where your limits are, you want to find out what parts of yourself are missing

* 2:11:00 - you want to calibrate your game, such that you still want to play today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and 30 years from now - to take on the right amount of chaos in life, is to take on enough water/chaos to nourish you to bring order in the world

* 2:12:00 - start by aiming at the star you can see, rather than the dim one behind it

* 2:14:00 - it is better to be engaged in the solution to a complex problem, than to have no problem at all - suicide is having no problems anymore

* 2:14:30 - sell responsibility, it gives people meaning, if meaning falls into tragedy, it was worth it over having nothing at all, as with tragedy you grew - this is the game of the seeker, it is the best game you can play - to adopt the responsibility of tragedy, and you'll play the best game

## Barbara

* **On our personal lives possibly manifesting myths:**

    * Every life is unique because we face problems in different details but there are commonalities / human universals.The archetype sometimes motivates you to something it wants; sub-personalities organise themselves.Maybe our lives manifest myths we are not aware of.

    * Does it mean that there is causality between myths and our lives?

    * Or is it "just" knowing of myths can orientate us in life and help us make a sense of the world?

    * Myths that reflect your personal experience can guide you in life, or even give you relief / comfort, e.g. Sisyphus

* **Blindness **- novel by[ José Saramago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel))

    * the mere fact that they can't be seen turns people into animals – similar explanation that JBP gave for excessive behaviour of people online: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEv6fUtoqjQ&list=PL22J3VaeABQDYQf5iQlKYXQlFebURZjVk&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEv6fUtoqjQ&list=PL22J3VaeABQDYQf5iQlKYXQlFebURZjVk&index=1)

* **On the necessity of having a best friend:** in Queen Elizabeth's great grandchild's nursery, children are not allowed to have a best friend – this is harmful social engineering: you need a best friend to learn how to build relationships.

    * Our own experiences:

        * What kind of a role have friendships played for you?

        * Have your parents approved of your friends?

        * Is it OK for married people with kids not to have a best friend?

* Questions

    * What precisely constitutes a belief system?

        * Why are people so inclined to even engage in conflict to maintain and expand their belief systems?

        * Is there an alternative to conflict with regards to belief systems?

        * Is there a way of judging the relative quality of belief systems?

* How is it possible to understand the structures by which we orient ourselves in the world?

    * What's the psychological significance, precisely, of those systems?

    * What roles do they play in psychological health, and, maybe also in social health?

    * Can you make a non-relativistic case when you assess an array of different value systems?

    * Is it possible to hierarchically organise value systems in a manner that's justifiable? So that something can be reasonably considered in a superior or subordinate position?

* The question with the Cold War was:

    * Was this just a battleground between two hypothetically equally appropriate belief systems, which could be morally relativistic.

    * Belief systems are arbitrary and combat between them is in some sense inevitable and even more to the point: there isn't any other way around the discontinuity in some sense other than combat or subordination because there is no way of announcing a victor. There’s no such thing as victory if there’s no way of ranking belief systems.

* Modernism: scientific method: strip the subjective from the phenomena; eradicates subjectivity

* Difference between 'is' and ‘ought’: David Hume

    * value systems are independent from empirical …

    * can one of these systems be determined as wrong

* Humans have inhabited / been obsessed by archetypal myths

* Cybernetic systems: starting point => end point: story / map

    * make sense of the infinite numbers of data around you

    * mobile / targeted creature: what you aim for / your desires	

    * elements of exploration and memory, but this interpretation is empty: because you are born with a structure

    * infant is far more formed than what we think

    * It's not just mother / chaos there but also the father / order: 

    * Because one needs constraints: 

        * I have to organise myself so that I can play a game with you

        * if your map doesn't take you there where you’d like to get it’s untrue or rather: not functional

    * Can belief systems be tested on validity?

        * If a society fails due to its belief system, then that system should be abandoned.

* Food for thought for next saturday

    * **Mom Lecture 12, between 41:00 and 49:00: **JBP says if you have a really good map it will take you from point A to point B and it'll always work. But what about not following a map, just taking risks / gambling and give things a chance / let things go?

    * **On the necessity of a best friend / friends in general: **

        * What role have friendships played for you so far?

        * Have your parents approved of your friends?

        * Is it OK for married people with kids not to have a best friend?

## @balupton

* 1:30 - when you get where you are going, it is a validation of how you got there

* 3:00 - you have evolved perceptions, that orient themselves around your objectives - via an interpretative framework, that has evolved over time - constraints; a game you want to play, a game you can play with other people, a game that when you play produces the desired results in the world - the interpretive framework sets out the description of the landscape where the game is played, and the rules of the game

* 7:00 - chaos is what causes your deterioration and death - so you build an enclosure to protect you - but all enclosures can be invaded from the outside and from within - our nature is to understand the nature of the threat of chaos - the threats are external, social, and from each individual from our intrinsic malevolence

* 9:00 - what is the worst possible snake? what do you do against the worst possible snake? some possible answers; you confront it, you sacrifice to it

* 9:30 - god, the spirit of the great father, is the conceptualisation of what bargains with for rewards in their game

* 13:00 - when we focus on something, it is because we haven't mapped it properly - we don’t need to focus on things we’ve mapped - until an object (a thing which we object) get in the way of our map, then which we focus on it

* 14:00 - apocalyptic - a traumatic intrusion that blows out everything we've mapped

* 15:30 - threat wakes us up - we now know we are in a constant state of infinite threat, so we become hyper-awake, and have taken arms against chaos, constantly build enclosures and take precautions for the future, and live safe lives - we traded pain for anxiety (moneyless man: comfort for adventure)

* 17:00 - the abstract snake, is the threat that undermines your conceptual schema

* 17:15 - the worst snake is a malevolent one, as it breaks maps - the way out of PTSD (where someone naive was victimised), is to strengthen yourself, to no longer be naive, and to no longer be victimised - Nietzsche, if you look into an abyss long enough, you will turn into a monster, but you should hope to control it (with good of mind, you do not get possessed by it, resentment will lead to vengeful) - without your capability for mayhem, you will fall victim to mayhem, you need your sword, but it should be sheathed, and you need to develop the ability to use it - how were you so naive, how could you be such a sucker? (you need to open/widen your eyes up to your own flaws to protect yourself from your own blindness/naivety) - to survive life, you need to be able to withstand tragedy, and withstand malevolence, as they are the two forces working against you - the jungian idea of incorporation of the shadow - if you are a predator, you pick the timid and won't fight back, they are looking for someone who cannot conceptualise what they are

    * << cynicism is an appropriate response >>

* 23:30 - agoraphobia - never conceptualised death and suffering - you don't make them less afraid, you make them braver - women get this more, as they go to overprotective dependence, and stay weak and protected - there’s no protection of authority from death, recourse to authority can not solve death - oh no I’m going to die, and I’m going to make a fool of myself doing it, and attract a lot of attention

    * << chuck from better call saul, no conception of evil (what he considers his brother, or at least, what he can see exists in potion in his brother), and when bad things happened, he PTSD's and developed his fear of electricity, agoraphobia,, and now eventually after fear of death and looking like a fool, must now become braver >>

    * the two big fears come up, mortality, and social judgement - panic attack, and things get out of control, and then they start to avoid the places they've had their panic attacks - Tiamat comes back, big predator, little victim - they’re done, their naivety is over

    * << the SJW having the freakout about confederate flag rug, and breaking down in parking lot) >>

    * they've met the terrible mother  and the terrible father (**which is which? **social judgement, mortality) - solution is to take apart the things you are afraid of, conceptually and pragmatically, and you will realise you are tougher than you think - kids should not run to authority, hide behind the great father, and do not learn how to do it themselves - an elevator fear, is a fear of a tomb

    * << would be funny if the elevator had a ice hockey mask serial killer in it, as it would blow out what they thought was their worst fear (an elevator, or in the case of the woman SJW, a man standing passively across the car park) with a real legitimate snake, that authority cannot protect them from) >>

    * when these PTSD people recover, they also start standing up for themselves in all sorts of ways

* 29:30 - some guys even in the 20s-40s still are deathly afraid of the judgement of their father, because they are still holding onto the belief that there is someone out there that knows (cause that is the advantage of having your father as a judge, because he knows, and until you realise that the father doesn't know, and no one really knows what you should do, even at times yourself, then you are not an adult) - many people will pick slavery to the great father (the real father, or society’s standards), to prevent that realisation for as long as possible

    * << which is why the dweebs at high school, pick a 40+ year career like accounting, where the career says it knows best, careers based on authority, structure - then they get let off 20 years later, and their entire world collapse) >>

* 30:00 - there is more to yourself, than you may think - people can get unbelievably tough, they can work in on the frontline of malevolence and death, and not get damaged by them

    * << JD in scrubs, and many other nurses/doctors undergrads who failed, and dropped out) >>

    * Nietzsche, every possible story can collapse, your beliefs and your belief system - sometimes a belief falls, and you can jump to another protective structure - until you realise protective structures cannot be trusted, then boom it falls over - so that is nihilistic - and jungian believes suicidal, and that the solution is to hold onto something rigid - and you want to stand in between chaos and rigidity - the solution to tragedy and malevolence is enough exposure to them so you can learn to control them - in playgrounds, we throw them in a yard with a bully, and say adapt, and the kid's task is to adapt

* 35:00 - kids run out, hit a limit, come back to the parent, the parent helps them with the limit - this repeats until eventually the parent has no answer, and the child has hit the same limit as the parent has hit - so what are you going to do with your life then bucko? how are you going to operate now? - you will hit problems they cannot solve for you, WITHOUT making you weaker - as a therapist, how do you not take your client's problems home with you (they could be having a good catastrophe - a non mental illness one), you DO not steal other people’s problems, as then they cannot solve them, you solve them - therapy, is helping people solve THEIR own problems

    * << consulting is being paid for YOU to solve the problems other cannot solve >>

    * you never solve a problem for someone, by removing the opportunity for them to solve their problem, THAT'S THEFT

    * << don't do other people’s homework (unless paid), you help them to do their own homework >>

    * Oedipal mother, I'll protect you at the cost of you being able to protect yourself, that is abuse

* 39:00 - the apocalypse is due to the insufficiency of conceptual schemes, so you must not rely on conceptual schemes but your ability to adapt yourself to ever-changing circumstances

* 41:00 - what would happen if people devoted themselves to minimising misery and straightening things out - the goal is self-actualisation, and there is still a lot of room for improvement there, there is still so much waste of ourselves and others in that regard, that we can improve upon - if the state collapsed, it is because we did something wrong

    * << I use to say, if life is complex, you are doing it wrong - I also use to say, everything is my fault, as I believe I have the cards to impact anything >>

    * Dostoyevsky said that everyone is responsible for everyone else, it is a transcendent ideal, depressed people can get hyper-responsible, and it can crush them

* 45:30 - the hostile brother is a archetypal motif - is is the part in you that is striving for the light, and the part of you that is seeking destruction "oh to hell with it" (become destructive of the thing/the-brother you admire) - if you want to destroy something, you want to destroy an ideal, not something that is flawed

    * << the school shooters are destroying the ideal of civil society >>

* 49:00 - privilege isn't that great, as things get handed to you

    * << who exactly is the privileged one feminists and marxists?! with your rewards for the underprivileged >>

    * one of the problems of being reasonable wealthy when you have children, is you deny your children of privation (you can just provide your kids with everything you want, their desires will grow and their capacity to provide for themselves diminishes, causing an inverse of the correct ratio)

    * << it also removes their pride, and increases their victimhood >>

    * spoilt is they get everything, by doing nothing

    * << SJW's want to be spoilt, in the way they view others as, by the way they their landscape of games, it is very trivial way of seeing the world, as it removes agency, and only provides authority >>

* 52:00 - god exists where awe is experienced, is perfectly reasonable as what you are trying to do, is to formulate the transcendent, and when you do it, you will feel awe

* 52:00 - arguments for the conceptualisation of god, and the legal system

* 54:30 - civility is the respect for another's manifestation of the logos

    * << this was a discussion point from last week's meeting, that it is respect for one could be wrong, anyone could be wrong, and anyone could be right, and that could be for the best - it also ties in with my premises for a framework of operation >>

    * that which inspires awes is that which is transcendent - the thing that is true over time, is what you sacrifice to for rewards

    * << as what else would you sacrifice for? nothing, as you would only sacrifice to what is consistent, known, and guaranteed - unless you are foolish >>

    * storing up goods for the future, helps you live, imagine before that grand realisation was known, this sort of knowledge was gained in unbelievable agony - people starved to death over this learning

* 58:30 - the contract of stable society is that we will keep society stable enough so that the contracts/labor you invest, can be stored, and brought forward for rewards in the future - you sacrifice to the spirit of society that provides that social contract (this is the god the father, the spirit of the meta dominance hierarchy over time)

    * << what pissed me off about the U movie, is they were ignorant to this >>

    * god is happier when you sacrifice something of value - say you are miserable and unhappy, here is a cure - find something you value, and let it go… say it is a relationship you have, and the relationship is pathological, and you are locked into it, and you value it - sometimes when you suffer terribly, (when it is a card you can play), it is just because you just won't let go of the thing that is biting you - on the rules is: **if people are impeding your development, you sacrifice your relationship with them**, it is a very very rough rule

* 1:03:00 - you do not want to think of your ancestors as stupid just because they didn't have the same understandings you did, they were certainly smart as heck - you can read a book like you are above the authors, or you can read a book like the authors have something to teach you

* 1:08:00 - Geni Index - male on male competition occurs where there is differences in demographics, however they occur within demographics - **do we make our sacrifices through destruction or by getting our offerings in order - this is a fundamental political question? **- hostile resentment "it's unfair!" - the archetypical resentment, is when that resentment explodes over time into full fledged destruction of everything - Cain no faith in the transcendent, despite the social contract, no faith in the logos (youtube commenters).

* 1:15:00 - you've invited the spirit of wrongdoing in your life, and you have creatively intermingled with it voluntarily with it to bring forth a monster of your own creation

* 1:18:00 - the spirit in which he has transgressed tortures him from within, he continues to manifest himself as guilty until he receives the punishment he desired

* 1:20:00 - by violating your contract with god, by putting your spirit at odds, it is hard to rebuild that relationship

* 1:22:00 - justice systems are setup to - punish the guilty, have the guilty repent, maintain social order, alleviate you from the responsibility of revenge (without the latter, revenge goes unrestrained into feuds and then into war)

* 1:25:00 - vocab: artificer

* 1:26:00 - ties the individual psychopathology that is resentful and revenge-seeking with the proclivity for large-scale warfare 

* 1:27:00 - jordan believes - fascistic societies are fascist from the micro (family) the macro (organisation)

* 1:29:00 - if you can't figure out what someone is doing and why, look at the outcome, and infer the intention - not always applicable, but sometimes useful

* 1:32:00 - vocab: metonymy

* 1:33:00 - you don't want to use one level of analysis at the sacrifice of other methods of analysis

* 1:35:00 - one of the things you see in myths, if there is a pattern of behaviour that is characteristic of the culture, that pattern of behaviour is attributed to the person who was the first to do it, as the hero << this would be why the Americans love their founding fathers so much >> the mythicalisation occurs the the level of selecting who to historicise and in what details

* 1:41:00 - things fall apart merely because they age, they decay, this is because of entropy - degenerate entropically - things fall apart on their own accord - you have to maintain things to keep them in relevant existence - do you accelerate the decay by failing to pay attention? - chaos will wipe you out from time to time, as entropy doesn't enter your conceptual schemes and your wilful blindness speeds the process

    * << is this why teenage life is turmoil-ous >>

    * what do you do in the ultimate and traumatic collapses? do you want a life with no storms, or do you want a life where you ride out the storms? to be the boat builder and the captain of the boat - if you want to withstand chaos, do you want to be who you are, or do you want to be the thing that changes who you are constantly? are you who you are, or the thing that can be continually be more than who you are - this is the same as the way the state subjugates to the individual, as the individual transforms the state

    * << 1:54:00 MAGA >>

* 2:02:00 - when things fall apart, they become hyper-intellectualised and hyper-organised

* **2:03:00-2:12:00** - over 200 people, people fractionate into groups, as we can't conceptualise more than 200 people - we interpret the world through 200 people we have conceptualised

* 06:00 - no mythology in communism, universities is pushing equity as equality of outcome - who decides, by what means, by what groups - never going to get equality of outcome in the infinite amount of ways we can divide people up, unless you want everyone to have nothing

* 07:30 - is there ideas that western civilisation is built upon, if so, what are they?

* 14:00 - the idea that predicates western civilisation, is that there is a transcendent morality - and unless one does that, then they have no defences against pathological ideologies - and if you believe you can replace tradition with yourself, there is nothing to keep you humble and you may think yourself a demigod

* 22:00 - a leader gives articulation to the imagination of those he leads

* 29:00 - there are things that think in you - we say "I had a dream" not that “I dreamt” - cloud atlas uses “dreamt”

* 33:00 - how to manifest yourself properly in the world - is the ultimate question - and the one we have been working on since the beginning of time - culture strives to aid you in this question

* 36:00 - morality emerges itself from playing games, the meta-morality arises from playing life - what is common between all of them, the pyramid of value -** the unity of our value and how we order it**

* 39:00 - the role dominance hierarchies has on those who play

* 41:00 - we populate the unknown with the fantasy of deities using our imagination

    * << what if we have a damaged imagination? >>

* 42:00 - the imagination and predisposition for language, is a structure clinging to define itself

* 44:00 - nihilistic - why bother solving a problem if it is a hydra, versus giving up and dying - malevolent: it's too much, we must destroy it all

* 45:00 - archetypes are representation of adaptive behaviour

* 48:00 - what do you want to subordinate yourself to? what do you pick to be your ruler?

* 49:00 - when you are torturing yourself with your conscience, what ideal are you ignoring that is causing that?

* 50:00 - structures tend to become pathological in nature - seth - you want to destroy the pathological stuff and revise it with new learnings

    * << isn't that what the feminists and postmodernists are doing? >>

* 58:00 - precise thought (left hemisphere - picture of details, excludes many things), incomplete thought (right hemisphere - picture of everything, full of contradictions) - dreams sacrifice coherence for completeness - waking thought sacrifices completeness for coherence

* 59:30 - we have to face everything, even if we don't understanding anything completely

* 1:04:00 - an equilibrated state is when the individuals benefit as much as the group, and it cannot be done alone, so the individuals want that - this stacks on many levels

* 1:08:00 - slide of eden

* 1:13:00 - slide of bible links 

* 1:15:00 - slide of bible summary

* 1:24:00 - groups should reward those who bring productive vision

* 1:27:00 - the law is articulation of the best rules we have - which still assumes you as an individual is sovereign

* 1:33:00 - humans are genies (the uniting god) in a bottle (human body)

* 1:50:00 - western societies are aware of the mortality of the future, so they sacrifice the present for the future with work

* 2:08:00 - healthy kids are healthy enough to find trouble and to solve it - unhealthy kids avoid trouble as they can't cope with it

* 2:10:00 - it's great but it’s not good enough

* 2:17:00 - can we live harmoniously with the thought of death?

* 0:00 - recap of jung, archetypes

* 3:30 - how do you sell a political message to someone if it isn't about something they consider important

* **5:30 - roughly speaking, any coherent ordering principle is better than none - partly what has to be provided to individuals as they grow from adolescent to adult, is an ordering structure - before you are disciplined, you are not free, you are just chaotic**

* 7:30 - you must have an identity that can withstand the most profound doubts in your life with equivalent force

* 8:30 - << part of Peterson's goal is to protect your identity against ideological possession >>

* 16:00 - strategies to win all the set of games

* 18:00 - we figure things out by assimilating them into our actions, and then into knowledge - children can only do it this way - we have to figure out how we are being modified only in afterthought

* 21:00 - brain size in chimps is correlated with group size

* 22:30 - a play is only interesting if it it involves enough of you, and others, to be able to match what you know with what you don't know - if it is just things we don’t know, there is no matching it to our own life, and can only be discarded - if it is only things we know, then it is also useless

* 24:30 - an archetype is what is common between stories

* 27:30 - in trepidation we seek nourishment

* 28:50 - slide

* 29:00 - the categorisation of entities depends on how their category relates to another

* 33:30 - primary caregivers for children should not change, it destabilised the child

* >33:30 - children learning games and processing new information - sleep is for when they have processed enough - once you have ascended your parents security you are an adult

* 37:00 - there is no learning without the sacrifice of things you knew that were not true/valuable/optimised

* 38:45 - girlfriend / mother

* 39:00 - getting challenged - the only time we want challenge is once we know that not being challenged is worse - you want to be a master of revising yourself with each challenge so you can revise quicker and better - then unknown becomes your friend instead of your enemy - **the only time you want something, is when you know the alternative is worse**

* 41:38 - slide

* 42:20 - categories of unknown: latent and manifested

* 43:00 - successful relationship positive-to-negative ratio is between 5:1 and 11:1, <5:1 is too hard, >11:1 is too easy (no challenge)

* 45:00 - slide - betray your destiny, and see how long it is until you are drowning in a storm, as what is calling you to be your best (your destiny) is exactly what is pulling you forward to manifest yourself most fully in the world, if you run away from that, the boat will start rocking very quickly

* 51:22 - slide - Jesus voluntarily accepted the role of life and death and rebirth - the dramatists get there before the artists who get there before the philosophers

* 52:44 - slide of Venus - **men use the image of female perfection to motivate themselves, and to try and make themselves worthy**

* 57:00 - slide

* 1:00:30 - does your category have a functional representation?

* 1:01:00 - slide << teenagers love thrills (horror movies, adventure rides, risky escapades) because they can familiarise themselves with the unknown while they still have adult backup — too early, too much damage, too late, no backup

* 1:02:00 - fire is magical to us as we are the only species that had the significance to master it - Lucy scene - in the face of horror and death, you make sacrifices, to transform the destructive nature into something that you need

* 1:08:30 - if you have a problem with all women, or you have a problem with all men, then you are the one with the problem, as they are telling you what is wrong with you and you are not listening

*  1:20:00 - it's not just a position of power, it is also a position of overwhelming responsibility - feminists/marxists/socialists/communists want all the power, and zero responsibility << is this a feminine trait? >>

* 1:21:00 - the older you get, the more important family is - the utility of your career peaks at around 35 - you need family around 50 and especially at 80 - the birth control pill / female contraceptive allowed females to compete in the same areas as men - well done feminism - it is a very rare woman who doesn't have a primary desire in their 30s to have children, it is a woman with severe issues who doesn’t

* 1:38:00 - 2 slides

* 1:39:00 - "I'll never let anything happen to you" NO, make people strong so things can happen to them

* 1:40:00 - rights vs responsibility, it is so demeaning that you have to be protected with rights, there is a responsibility gap in the market, conservatives can sell responsibility to people, which gives them meaning, and wins the markets - the more responsibility the more GLORY, do something difficult and heroic and break out of your bonds

* 1:42:14 - slide, son devouring the father

* 1:45:30 - slide, Moses getting the rules

* 1:46:00 - courage

* 1:59:10 - slide

* 2:00:00 - flow - the religious aspects of ceremony/flow has been stripped away through careless criticism - people hunger for flow more deeply than anything else

* 2:03:00 - conscientiousness and delaying of gratification isn't there, IQ is there - delay gratification is a sacrifice - you can only delay gratification is your societal structure is stable, as delaying gratification depends on stability in order to get your reward, this is why when the future becomes uncertain, people become stop delaying gratification

* 2:07:00 - **as memes become successful, they eventually manifest themselves in genes**

* 2:10:00 - are you as educated as you are intelligent - if there is a mismatch, that is a pathology

* 2:11:00 - if you are sick, you do everything you can, with all at your disposal, to get better - you leave your pride behind if you have to - it is very different to have a terrible life and to have depression

* 2:12:00 - can the sense of meaning be hijacked (yes sub-personalities) - video games do this, but hopefully in a cooperative conscious way, thus need balance -** the question is how do you stop yourself from falling prey to a pathological sense of meaning, and one of the answers to that is to not lie - if you pathologise your psyche, then your internal structure is warped and no longer provides an accurate interpretation of reality - it is very hard to speak the truth, as the truth is a shapeshifter, but we do know how not to lie - if you are going to rely on your sense of meaning, make sure you do not pollute the mechanism - confession is to identify the leaks before they get worse**

* Thoughts on "Jordan Peterson Steps In It (MGTOW)" – a critique about Peterson's claims on Men Going Their Own Way [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXhwasAOly0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXhwasAOly0)

    * There's really some exaggeration and apparently statistically unproven claims made by JBP during his lecture but …

    * "Women tell you what's wrong with you."

        * It's not individual women’s words in specific situations that JBP thinks should be considered as truth and be guided by. Both men and women should listen to the opposite sex in general have to say and watch what they do, who they choose etc.

    * As opposed to JBP and MRA (men's rights activism) MGTOW doesn’t seem to be that interested in finding a solution – if individual men avoid starting a family, it won’t prevent the disadvantages men outside the MGTOW movement suffer during a divorce.

    * After feminism has already fulfilled its purpose, i.e. given women equal rights in voting, education, etc.) and has clearly gone too far in the past years (with 3rd and 4th wave and Social Justice), we need a movement / an attitude that makes men and women agree on things – not sheer counter-feminism.

* Ideal man according to women:

    * Google findings about erotic/pornographic literature: vampire, werewolf, pirate, billionaire, surgeon

    * JBP: women don't like harmless but dangerous men who can be civilized

    * danger is rather attractive for fantasies

    * taming is more attractive for the realistic aspect –  kind of character development

    * Who could the frog/toad represent in tales that is to be kissed or taken into bed by the Princess and turns into a Prince. Could it be

        * someone who is wild and uncivilized who is waiting for a woman to be tamed?

        * an ugly guy who can jump loops if he tries hard enough and manages to please the woman?

    * men's sense of humour appreciated by women:

        * a predominantly masculine trait (women don't usually crack jokes as a pastime among each other)

        * wittiness: an indicator of intelligence (that can show that the man is higher in that hierarchy)

        * helps women to unwind

    * men are better at discriminating (also important in management roles)

    * women tend to believe everything

    * What makes a man marriageable?

        * It depends on how desperate / selective she is.  It can range FROM 1) Being ready to act as a décor in the woman's life TO 100) being the highest possible in all possible dominance hierarchies

        * A fairly large (10-20% ?) percentage of men are not regarded marriageable by women (*chart about Tinder-results below)

        * 10 percent of marriages could be motivated by financial gain

    *  Ideal woman according to men:

        * Beautiful

        * able to leave the man alone J

        * not domineering

* 0:00 - what are the constants of experience?

* 10:00 - ontology - are abstractions any more real than what they represent? are numbers any more real than the things they represent?

* 15:00 - being is - the individual (the unit of agency that fights the other two), who is aware of the territory they know (structure, society, culture - nurture-determinism) and don't know (chaos, mother nature - nature-determinism) - a story is the development of an individual (including of their agency/consciousness) across time through encounters with culture and nature

* 18:00 - environmentalists eliminate some characters from their narratives - the 3 negative characters we must be aware of to avoid naive perceptions destroying frame of reference (human malevolence), the dragon of chaos and potential (the category contains that which is beyond our understanding / safe societies) - complex entities are paradoxical in their structure, and we must know that to survive - we must develop a category for the things we don't know, to know how to approach it and work with it (a paradox)

* 22:00 - how do you prepare yourself against getting what you want from the realm of dangerous chaos - this is the question of life - how to deal with that which is beyond your understanding, that is constantly manifesting itself in the world - this occurs every time you categorise something and then it escapes from the category

* **22:00 - you do not exhaust relationships nor the world with your perceptual categories**

    * << SJWs do this: we've categorised you into a box, DO NOT JUMP OUT OF THE BOX WE’VE PUT YOU IN! - which is why they still call Milo a racist homophobe, because they can’t accept he is outside the box they’ve made for him, because they cannot deal with the complexity of the world - religion and marxism and ideology seem to offer people the illusory escape from complexity with overly simplistic rhetoric that fails to handle the everyday exceptions - then their correlating temperamental agreeableness, uses their empathy viciously against those they consider the enemy against whom they consider protected >>

    * << agreeableness provides comfortable environments where competition/challenge is eliminated for amiability, to provide an in-group, that is then hostile to the out-group, this is fine and dandy and local levels, but their desire for holistic and expansion drives it to macro globalism, which is not compatible, as it has no respect for other temperaments to exist simultaneously, only homogeneity - it is the belief that two people only disagree because they have not been argued with enough, with the goal for holistic integration, into a homogeneousness solution. >>

* 23:00 - henry ford, assembly line, a machine is always driven by an idea - there are snakes in every idea, that may never present themselves for years - even god himself could not get rid of the snakes in the garden

* 27:00 - female chimps are not selective matters, only human females are

* 28:00 - there is no better definition of nature, than 'that which selects'

* 29:30 - if you are to determine what is true, you must be able to detect the system of categories, by utilising multiple methods - multi-method multi-trait process - how do you determine if something actually has an existence - you must be able to measure it in multiple ways, and get convergent information that purports its existence

* 31:30 - evolutionary, neurologically, conceptually all purport to what Peterson believes, as there are 3 different systems that converge, it makes it hard to disbelieve

* 33:00 - slide - perceptions, filtering, constantly active in our filtering selection, never unbiased - Kant - **a blank slate cannot process information, as it has no bias - the more differential abilities you have, the better you are at understanding the world **- the logos, the knower, is what is doing that harvesting - it begins in a nascent low-resolution form - low-resolution knower, low-resolution world, low-resolution category-system (and low-resolution sensory system?) which all develop over time 

* 38:00 - brain systems - abstract thought and its role - intelligence and conscientiousness - intelligence is an indicator of the effectiveness of abstraction, and conscientiousness is an indicator of the probability of application - this separation must occur, as if they were the same, then there would be no thinking, it would just be action - it seems to take something like willpower to connect the two, and we don't understand that very well

* 40:50 - slide

* 44:00 - brain surgery only happens when you are awake

* 49:40 - slide

* 50:00 - you teach the children micro strategies, that evolve into macro strategies, even if they and you cannot articulate the representation - children can only play with themselves at the start, then they learn around 2-4 to unite the games

* 52:00 - how can you have dreams that tell you things they don't know - how can people tell stories with information they don’t understand - information is encoded in behaviours that we do not understand

* 53:40 - facesnap and another moments later

* 53:30 - story structure - similar to the video I shared to the study group

* 55:50 - people fight within themselves / against themselves when there is no higher authority

    * << people innately and always fight authority, when there is no authority, they fight each other, when each other is not authority, they fight themselves - this is the postmodernists, they dismantle authority, so they always fight everything >>

* 56:00 - english common law creation, the invention of laws from the patterns of ways of being

* 57:18 - facesnap

* 59:30 - as a parent you a model for emulation, what you say doesn't matter nearly as much as what you do, the ideal is to do what you say - because rules are vacuous unless they are practical when acted out in behaviour - is you don’t do as you say, then you are confused, and if you are confused, it makes them anxious and annoyed, and they will go after you - consistency, and if you can’t provide it, you will drive them crazy - **bringing your words and your actions into alignment, that is part of the development of wisdom**

* 1:02:00 - people's faces constantly broadcast their faces - someone who has had too much plastic surgery, are uncanny

* 1:03:00 - if you are transparent, then people can trust you - if you are not, then people don't trust you, and won’t cooperate with you, they will compete with you, as you will be evil predator in no time flat

* 1:03:47 - slide - brain hemispheres  - right-handed males have a simpler brain - dreams - if you are dealing with things you don't know, you have too much around with your category structures, this is what dreams do - **process of learning - turning low-resolution representations of what is frightening, into high-resolution representations that can be used into tools to create amazing things** - basics of ethics and morality, uniquely human

* 1:13:30 - dominance hierarchies

    * << perhaps that is why we don't consider James Bond to be a role model, as he plays one game well, whereas Remington Steele attempts all the games and does fairly well at them and learns - dominance hierarchies and social parties, negative judgements, looking down means you are no threat >>

* 1:17:30 - look at what is not going right, as it is where you get the most valuable information of what you need to know, which is why it is so important to discuss with your enemies, as they know what you don't know

* 1:19:45 - facesnap

* 1:23:00 - positive emotion is associated with moving forward - people who are happy all the time, are impulsive and make mistakes - the people who push happiness as the key, are so ill-informed - you need a balance of positive and negative emotions

    * << this section covers a friend I know >>

* 1:27:00 - slide

* 1:35:00 - development of ethics

* 1:37:00 - to play a game multiple times, you need to develop mutually rewarding rules - psychopaths just play the game once, then play with another, if you play a game once, you can do whatever you want regardless of rules

* 1:39:00 - development of values - honesty, caring, power - different ethics and values emerge depending on the prevalent situations, which are then manifested in different stories according to where they are relevant

    * << our demotion from god to myth, is our demotion of the relevance of the story in our current situation >>

* 1:42:00 - a good story must have motivational power and keep uncertainty at bay

    * << perhaps this is what the great youtubers do, pewdiepie's story is incredibly motivational, and his content of the videos keep uncertainty at bay - just the same with Jordan Peterson! >>

* **1:43:00 - the gods of abstractions compete in the manifestations of the tribes**

    * << the tribes that succeed, have the best abstractions, the best gods, their gods win, as their gods manifest more successful representations of the world - in the new secular world, we are destroying the gods, and such destroying our abstractions, and thus destroying what has made us successful… Nietzsche's Superman >>

    * << the best philosophers had incredible observation and discrimination abilities, they were able to take in the widest breadth of observation, and distil it with pristine discrimination, into the purest forms of truth, which lasts aeons >>

    * << with only observation, you overload yourself and never enter into creativity to solve the problem in practice, you only see the dragon and never able to formulate the plan and put it into action to kill it >>

    * << with only discrimination, you can only understand the small subset of things you do filter, and never able to discover anything from the unknown, you never fight a dragon or even your own dragons, as you were too busy dismissing their existence >>

    * << this is the SJWs, chaos scares them, so they never venture into it, they just keep the low-resolution category of one big dragon, and never formulate a practical plan to kill it, as they are cowards, they other-ise the evil from their perceived immaculation, failing to see the dragon of the outside also exists within the inside, failing to see their own dragons, and all the characters that must manifest inside themselves to also manifest outside of themselves >>

    * << the hero is the one who is able to observe all the possible dragons, then discern through discrimination the pattern of the nature of dragons, then with humility discover the dragon within themselves, and with courage tame their inner dragon, then to test the assertion in the world by using their progress to attempt to conquer the outside dragon with their tamed inner one, which they may fail, and thus revise, or they may succeed, in which case they should then teach, so the world can too conquer the dragons and make progress together >>

    * << however the charlatan, the cynic, who sits on the bench and never conquers their own dragon, never tames it, is useless to everyone, and can only be used as a bad example >>

    * << which is why the hero is the one who got up again, after each failure, learning how to play each game better - and the failure is the one who deemed all games as rigged and stop playing all of them >>

    * << which is why Peterson says if you want to change the world, sort yourself out first, and start by cleaning your room >>

* 2:06:40 - slides

* 2:08:00 - you have to voluntary confront the things that scare you - there doesn't seem to be a limit to this - christ and snakes

* 2:09:00 - dreaming, daydreaming, using dreaming as psychotherapeutic treatment - do not lead the witness

* 2:14:00 - motherly, fatherly trust and encouragement

* 2:18:00 - Egyptian myths applied to government - leading to individual sovereignty in western world

* 0:00 - recap again

* 4:00 - quiescent

* 5:00 - humans also need to consider their organisation in the short term, but also in the long term, and across people - **there isn't that much difference in establishing a value system that works for you now, tomorrow, and in the future for yourself, and doing the same for others** - so you should share what works (11:30) - we assemble our identities from our stories and the stories we hear - and archetype is what is common across multiple stories, so an archetype is like a meta-story

* 7:00 - competitive brain functions

* 15:50 - they make the same kind of mistakes, which is an indication they are functioning in much the same way…

    * << so do they already have low-level intelligence structures/systems? >>

* 16:30 - you ignore almost everything, but you concentrate on things that move you along your away, or obstacles that get in your way

* 16:40 - valence

* 17:00 - drugs and reward systems

* 18:00 - one of the things we are trying to compute is how emotionally reactive you should get to an event

* 20:00 -** when you encounter something positive, you echo it through the different meaning levels - when you encounter something negative, you wish to constrain its propagation through meaning levels**

* 20:45 - naive to PTSD to descending to chaos

* 22:00 - hippocampus is context aware stress responses, the amygdala is non-context aware stress responses - treatment to PTSD is to set up contexts to contain the fears

* 24:00 - people do like the anomalies as it destroys their stories

* 25:00 - << it doesn't seem in the irrelevant category at that point, as you haven’t even encountered it yet! it should be in none of your boxes! irrelevant box is for things that you have encountered by filled as irrelevant >>

* 26:00 - the most common patient is not someone with a mental illness, but someone who has been overwhelmed by catastrophe

* **27:00 - the role of psychology / therapy** - preparing for catastrophes will help manage them if they do occur (seems a conservative trait - people with their nuclear bunkers, etc)

* 30:00 - evolution is a conservative process - the unknown is a source of predators, but also positive possibilities - we are always looking for more ways of producing what we need

* 36:00 - how do we construe the occurrence, is a minor event or a major event, within our meaning map layers - always start at the minor event, otherwise everything becomes a catastrophe (major event)

* 39:00 - << that's a really easy way to change a sub-modality, bet someone they can’t do it (aka provide the endurance of the negative with a worthwhile reward) >>

* 41:00 - goal setting, work up from the easiest level of abstractions, to the more complicated/higher level of abstractions - do not try to cascade failures, depressed people do that << perhaps give them MDMA >>

* 42:30 - bottom of dominance hierarchy - when you are the bottom, there are way more threats to you, it is dangerous there!

    * << pewdiepie covered this in his interview video, that while he was at the bottom, hard to find job, hard to find rent, hard to find apartment, all worries - but he worked hard, and with the richness, he has the security of not worrying about those things >>

    * what seems to happen with people who are depressed, as if they have plummeted down the dominance hierarchy, even without plummeting down it, they are still capable and able with lots of status, but their reduced serotonin seems to have fooled them - resilience seems to be how many cascades you can withstand - in therapy, you get people who are concerned with a negativity cascade to walk through the micro details of the lowest anomaly, then what are the multiple ways this can be interpreted, is there some possibility this is not the catastrophe that you were envisioning - in a way, this is setting up micro-defences for them - a lot of people who are prone to depression are not good at defending themselves - they don't have at hand, the mechanisms to forgive themselves, or to even understand their own failures, or more importantly sometimes they radically overestimate their own incompetence, and radically overestimate the competency of everyone else

    * << this seems to be the cucks in the information technology field having imposter syndrome, and also the ideal state that marxists inflict on others, marxism seems to turn imposter syndrome people violent in resentment >>

* **45:00 - the role of social evaluation in depression**

    * << youtube seems to reward and a be method of social evaluation - every video puts you up for social evaluation, and as pewds say, you can either have a weak mind and drop out and not accept the evaluation, or you can have a strong mind, accept the evaluation and use it to make yourself stronger -- it also seems to be what happens in failing relationships, they never talk about their issues with outsiders, so bad ideas, and bad occurrence, never get outside feedback to correct themselves at the earliest stages >>

* 47:15 - slide

* 47:50 - slide

* 48:00 - going up, and dropping a frame (a meaning map layer), is that the best solution, or addressing the problem at the sub frame level? dropping a frame creates new problems as void now exists, and is a sacrifice as you already added things to that frame

    * << myself dropping hockey >>

* 56:30 - safe spaces

* 57:00 - memory systems - if you go back in your memories, we remember things that can provide us with errors - then continuation into learning what you did wrong, (conscientiousness people)

* 59:45 - precipitously, impetuous

* 1:00:00 - conscientiousness people - mass layoffs set conscientious people on the road to depression, as they can blame themselves and tear themselves apart, when it may not have had anything to do with them - the alternative to something being your fault, is that it just happened!

    * << and that challenges your worldview, as it means chaos is out there, and it touched you, and there was nothing you did to deserve it >>

    * << part of being mature, is to understand you are prey to random forces, and you need to be able to distinguish when you are at fault for something and when something just happened to you - the right rule of thumb is to start with the assumption that something just happened to you, then start to investigate the extent you had in it - situational analysis first, personal analysis second - if you start with the latter, you will take yourself apart before you give yourself a way out, which is very stressful, and you should leave that for emergencies >>

    * **<< how does this play with cause vs effect?** it seems this recommendation leaves you at effect, it seems more useful to live in cause, and then when something negative happens, then starts with effect - so cause for outward actions, because then you have power over the world, and that is motivating - and effect for inward negative results? >>

    * you are at home happy, and then the dragon invades your lair - there is no place so safe that there isn't a monster in it (the snake in garden of eden)

    * << this goes against the evolutionary perspective of why the snake is there (so god can give people the choice to transform from unconscious animals to conscious humans which now have agency and responsibility, **which you would be hard pressed to argue is a malicious act of the snake…**) >>

* 1:05:00 - dragons can be found worldwide - **categories are constructed in relation to their functional significance**

    * **<< this would be why he is against the non-binary gender pronouns, **male female are function in relation to sex and the roles that sex begets onto them - the others are not, and only functional in relation to their ideology >>

    * the dog to a child is a representation of 4 legged pet(verb)-able creature

    * << so you would have to explain the cats functional difference to the child (it can jump high, and likes fish)

* 1:08:00 - snakes - garden of eden, is about an amalgam of social structure and nature, we need both - god is the spirit of civilisation - what humans were trying to peddle out was the nature of the predators - Saint Patrick - **tomorrow starts to matter as you get smarter - ****what we do is try and find the highest abstraction of predator**

* 1:16:00 - slide

* 1:17:50 - desires are expectations that are goal oriented

* 1:18:00 - lion king - your territory is the horizon of your understanding, and you are the king of that domain

* 1:20:00 - original sin

    * << what did he mean by that? >>

* 1:20:50 - *facesnap*

* 1:22:30 - slide

* 1:23:30 - moral order is progress - the self is the thing that remains the same through its different reincarnations - part of focus is about, looking at macro and micro levels for where you are not where you could be, and if you do that, it will take you apart a little bit, and burn you down to your core a little bit, and rebuild you a little bit -** what saves you in the eyes of the snake, is your capacity to let things go, and die, and come back to life**

    * << reminds me of my dream last night - dream journal entry #01 >>

* 1:26:48 - *facesnap*

* 1:31:00 - the stupid puppet (the one at the effect) is the one with the most to burn of themselves -** the nature of trauma, is you can't believe something like that can actually ever happen** - what traumatised people is malevolence, tragedy can traumatise if it is bad enough but generally they can withstand it - school shootings, islamic terrorism?

* 1:34:50 - gender roles - feminine things are the birthplace of things - people are stuck interpreting things through the biological platform they evolve

* 1:38:00 - real means: works now, works forever, applies now, applies everywhere

* 1:39:00 - children don't understand stories unless they are simply archetypical, as they need to make sense for the minimal structures the child has

* 1:41:11 - slide

* 1:41:40 - sleeping beauty - the hero is the exploratory, assertiveness, and courageous part of the feminine psyche that is necessary to bring the unconsciousness up into consciousness

* 1:44:00 - google: engineers just do it, psychologists would be too concerned with the ethics of this, but engineers don't care, they just plough right ahead, and they actually discover things - 5 types of male monsters - 1. vampire, sucks the life out of you 2. werewolf, sexy and nice but has a dark side 3. billionaire, competitive and ignores you 4. pirate, avoids responsibility and takes your prizes 5. surgeon, want to fix you - plot is the woman tames them

    * << wait, so a well rounded man isn't attractive to a woman? >>

    * there is no fun in taming someone who is already tame, there is no interest in that

    * << sigh, women need to get a life >>

    * when chaos does arise, what makes you think someone tame will be good for anything, so that aggression is absolutely vital and necessary, but that aggression needs to be civilised

    * << 50 shades of grey summed up completely >>

* 1:47:00 - slide - hero archetype story explained

* 1:48:15 - sexual dynamics

    * **<< WRITE THIS DOWN LATER >>**

* 1:49:18 - slide

* 1:50:45 - what is outside the cognitive structure, is latent information - information means, in formation - the domain of latent information is chaos itself

* 1:52:00 - your job is to be the master of the category of all things not yet mastered - and you can't do that, unless you conceptualise, so you have to conceptualise it into the meta predator - the gold hoarding dragon

* **1:52:00 - mastery is continual mastery, there is no difference - a lot of brilliance from here**

* 1:53:30 - he is the most favoured as he knows when to break the rules - you don't sacrifice the old rule unless you have a very good reason for doing so, what you propose must be better than the old way, and you must be ready to be touched by the spirit of the snake

* 1:55:30 - that is what being informed means, to be in form

* 1:57:00 - polytheism to monotheism (poly competitive ideals to integrated ideals) - Osiris (old king, Dumbledore, archaic, wilfully blind, Mufasa - great king, established the Egyptian state, founder of Egyptian customs - is what culture is, old and wilfully blind - dead, out of date, can't update themselves anymore - great when he was young, but will no longer looks where he needs to look - the spirit of structure, but spirit cannot be destroyed) - Set/Seth/Satan (Scar, malevolence, elections stop the dead from staying in power for too long) - Isis (queen of underworld, religious structure that prevailed over thousands of years - queen of hyenas) - Horus (Egyptian eye, falcon, Zazu) - things fall apart because they get old, and because malevolence undermines them - things that fall apart cannot be brought back together as they were - Seth destroys the order of Osiris, and up rises isis the queen of the underworld and longs to put the chaos into order, so she becomes pregnant, and returns to the underworld into Horus, he is the son of the great mother and the great father - Horus grows up outside the kingdom, in the underworld, that is where humans grow up, we are alienated from our fundamental culture, as we are new and it is old, but Horus can see and decides to fight Scar/Seth - Seth tears out one of Horus' eyes, and malevolence will damage you, Horus is able to banish Seth - banish as you can never remove evil, it will always return occasionally - Horus becomes king - but goes down to the underworld, and gives Osiris his eye, and now Osiris can see - when threatened by malevolence, even to the damage of your consciousness, you go down into the chaos, and find the dead spirit of your tradition and you give it vision, provided with vision, Osiris regenerates and Osiris go back up to the world with Horus, and rule jointly - the Pharaoh is the person who represents the unity of Osiris and Horus - you have to be awake to malevolence, and chaos, and you have to embody you tradition - and that puts you at the highest point on the dominance structure, it is the highest possible moral virtue, from the battle of the gods/ideals that occurred through thousands of years - it isn’t enough to be the best at a dominance hierarchy, it the best to be the best at all different dominance hierarchy - what puts you at the top is paying attention

## @John

* 11, people enjoy more complex stories because it gives them a useful bit of information for their complex lives

* 22, a fear of something can start to be dealt with by thinking of that thing under a different context.  Ie fear of snakes>A cartoon snake.

* 25, jaws. (The shark wasn't working which caused them to not show the shark, creating even more fear from within the human mind. Now is that fact of the shark not working meaningless? No, because why would we talk about it. Spielberg's willingness to adapt after being spurred on by the universe signalling his own inadequacies caused his endeavor to become even better than it would've been.

* 32, the most archetypal story is the person that went out into the unknown to come back with the reward. (Information)

* 39, he bet his daughter that she couldn't eat 20 olives over a week, then that backfired on him.

* 46, you don't have to live up to the ideal in a job,  just do better than everyone else at your level.

* 1,00, conscientious people will blame themselves whenever bad things happen to them. (That's the iconic Jewish motif, hence they're quite successful in their endeavors)

* 1,01, it's better to believe it's your fault, because then you can change yourself, while you're not powerful enough to change all of existence just yet. (Job)

* 1,30, the bible and Harry potter are both drawing from the same universally accessible archetypes.

## @balupton

* 2:30 - the current systems for organising chaos may indeed be oppressive, and they often are and may even involve murder - but being alone in the chaos is certainly not better - as such, we are are a lot better with these systems than without them, in fact they are the best systems we have through millions of years of evolution

* 6:30 - the dominance hierarchy is older than trees, it is one of the oldest things, and arises whenever two things must compete for the same scarce resource

* 9:00 - creates aren't making random choices, they are not random at all! everything has an evolutionary purpose that is incredibly purposeful and evolved

* 15:00 - disagree on conscientious as a female attraction market - there are subcultures where females do not go for that - gangstas, lower class, etc

* 16:00 - with increased cognitive flexibility - the amount of dominance hierarchies multiply - you can be successful socially (extroverts dominate that), intimate relationships (an agreeable person would do), competition (disagreeable person), open person (flexible creative environment), creative (come up with your game and make your own rules - ponzi and pyramid schemes)

* 17:00 - what is driving selection now is the ability to be successful IN MULTIPLE types of dominance hierarchies - to be flexible in the games

* <23:00 - humans have been able to internalise the evolution mechanics/game into our own system - such that we are able to create avatars, send them to battle against the enemy/chaos/etc and have the avatars die instead - brilliant - the future is a place where variants of you exist - where avatars of you exist - it is purely conceptual

* 26:00 - we react to patterns not object, we think we react to objects but that is not true, objects are a subcategory of patterns

* ~30:00 - we react to patterns, someone can be blind, but you show them a picture of a face in fear, and their body reacts accordingly, because their cognitive awareness of sight may be blown, but there are other pattern recognition systems that are not - this opens up huge medical options - as nothing is what it seems - we don't encounter, recognise, process, react - we do, but there are other systems that do it way faster, primordial systems

* 30:30 - cognition is super slow compared to lower systems, especially lower pattern recognition systems - a cobra that strikes you behind glass, you will still jump back - this is interesting, as it ties in with how our cognitive systems could inadvertently train negative patterns and strengthen negative systems within us, to recognise and act our patterns that we do not want, that override our cognition 

* 34:00 - competitors (all entities, including stars etc) make the world chaotic - as such the outside system is always changing to the systems we know **<< probably why people desire a heaven in a fantasy finite world of their making, or desire the end of the world to reduce complexity**

* <36:00 - there are parts of you that are quick and dirty, and there are parts of you that are slow and sophisticated (consciousness - hence why consciousness can't help you out in an immediate emergency)

* **>36:00 - what we are doing with practice, is building new specialised machines in our brain, just like programming - our conscious is continuously programming our unconscious - the purpose of consciousness is to make us functional unconsciously - if you are good at something, you hardly have to be conscious of it at all - so consciousness is something like a error recognition and correction system**

* 38:00 - paying attention to your flaws for error finding, routinely, may collapse yourself, as you get better at finding problems to an extent that's all you can do

    * << happened to me in 2014 from programming/debugging >>

* 42:00 - when you know what you are doing, you want to be operating in high resolution - that is filtering out everything unnecessary to make the necessary super detailed - low resolution is when your focus is broad but blurry** (scattered attention vs prolonged focus attention - at times, attention has to recharge and switch, to make sure it can still see the forest from the trees)**

* <43:30 - a framework specifies; the current condition, the desired condition, and the behavioural manifestations that are necessary to make the transformation

* <44:00 - motivations are the mechanisms that makes the world manifest themselves to you in keeping with your goals - they determine what is high resolution and what is low resolution, they determine the input you take onboard and the input you discard

* 45:00 - a tool is a meaningful pattern

* **47:00 - you can't derive ethics from facts, because there are an infinite size of facts, so which facts do you use? - by discriminating facts, you already are using an ethic, a process that is not based in facts**

* <49:00 - we see and describe the world in tools - meaningful patterns - knowledge can also be tools

* 50:00 - when something goes wrong, it is because something from the irrelevant that we dismissed, has contained an indeterminate set of irrelevant things that have now become relevant

* <51:00 - this all puts perception in the realm of ethics, as you see what you are aiming at

* **>51:00 - we live in a world of relevance, not in a world of facts - they are completely different things**

* **52:00 - what ethic best structures your perceptions? that is the interesting idea**

* 53:00  - if everything matters, then you're either on a LSD trip, a schizophrenic, or **_you’re in real serious trouble? - what does he mean? (explains at 25:00 in Lecture 7)_**

* 53:00 - the basis of cognitive knowledge is learned irrelevance - what to ignore

* **55:30 - BOOK: an ecological approach to visual perception - Gibson - fundamental conclusion is wrong, but the book is brilliant, because he came up with the idea of affordance**

* 58:00 - of course you see the world made up of things that matter, because you are the type of creature that cares about things that matter, because you don't want to die

* 1:00:00 - facts rarely matter, as people's inherit ethics makes them select from the infinite amount of facts those that are relevant to you

* 1:04:00 - value systems, and positive emotions, and motivations

* 1:07:00 - a positive meaningful event is one that is a success that also increases your probability of future successes

* 1:12:00 - you are never going to get it together, there are always more problems to solve - so focus on meaningful problems

* 1:17:00 - things in a room that do not serve the purpose of a room, are snakes, detracting from the purpose of the room

* 1:22:00 - neurotic people can't put their map back together, they need outside help

* **1:23:00 - when our action produces an expected result, then it means our map is correct, which moves us forward quicker**

    * **<< although, cynics do this too, to their own detriment (1:26:00) >>**

* **1:24:00 - you want to constrain the anomalous event to the minimum necessary domain**

* **1:27:00 - solution to depressive patterns:** what's the narrowest framework of interpretation which which I can understand this that will require minimal behavioural change to decrease the probability that it will happen again

* 1:27:30 - what you do today, scales to what you'll do tomorrow, to what you’ll do next week, to what you’ll do on and on - it also scales socially, what you do today, will have an effect on those around you, and those around them (the community), and so on 

* 1:29:00 - what it could be in psychology, is that your sense of meaning is a orienting force, to keep us balanced - and alternative philosophies compete with this

* **1:34:00 - image of the framework**

* **1:36:00 - if you are free, you cannot make predictions**

    * << as nothing is holding you in place, no continuity of narrative >>

* 1:40:00 - when you run out of answers as to your motivations, you step away from the rational domain and enter the metaphysical domain

* **1:43:30 - relation to Trichotillomania-style thinking, an anomaly occurs and start questioning our map**

* **1:44:50 - how to argue with someone for improvements - the sandwich technique done well**

* 1:46:00 - your emotional response should be proportionate to the level being assaulted by the anomaly

* 1:47:00 - don't have just one plan to get you where you want to go, so if one fails, you can survive on your path, rather than be thrown back to the start

* **>1:47:00 - **the arguments for balance are incredibly feminine arguments, as they destroy competitive excellence - the more balance you optimise for, the less likely you will be fantastic at any single one thing you balance for -** Jung: men go after perfection, women go after wholeness** - I want one thing in my life to be 150% versus I want 5 things in my life to be 80% - **the more you strive to optimise balance the more you won't be fantastic at any one thing (except balance)**

* 1:51:00 - most women in their thirties bailout of multidimensional careers, as they don't consider it worth it, socioeconomic status does not make women more attractive on the mating market (and it lowers the mates they want), but socioeconomic status for men does make men more attractive - women’s timeframe are compressed, they can only have kids by 35

* **1:52:00 - one of the most common routes to extreme unhappiness is to want children and never have them** - 1 couple in 3 over 30 have fertility problems (inability conceive after 1 year of trying) if that happens to you, you are in the medical mill for 10 years

* **1:53:00 - recap of the lecture, should quote this, as it will be a useful resource for adversity**

* 1:59:00 - serotonin and satiation recap

* 2:00:00 - being at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy and being depressed are the same thing biologically -** so are you depressed, or just at the bottom of a dominance hierarchy?** - the symptoms are pretty much similar, the the cause are cure are not the same at all

* **2:01:00 - if you do not have a value hierarchy you are lost, and if you are lost, you pursue impulsive hedonistic rewards, rather than satiation rewards, as satiation rewards require a value system to climb - if you are lost, you can only consider the immediate timeframe, which keeps you lost, a value system is the only way to consider the future and your place in it - to maintain and climb your value system, you need to pay attention to a lot of things at once, it is a complicated waltz, it requires responsibility - part of the reason people drink alcohol, is to get rid of their responsibility**

* 2:04:00 - conservatives and liberals don't get along, because conservatives do bind themselves to a particular frame (low in openness, high in conscientiousness)

* **2:05:00 - peter pan - brilliant - covers porn**

    * **you can chose your damn limitation (frame), or you can let it take you unaware when you are 30, or even worse when are 40, and then that is not a happy day - people can put of maturity today without immediate penalty, however the penalty accrues, so when it hits, and it wallops you - don't be an old infant - don’t just be potential, be potential manifested into something, that will make the world open up to you with opportunities and possibility - respect for blue collar work - jung: the proper path of development in the last half of life is to rediscover the child you left behind as you were apprenticing - you get to be something, and regain that potential at the same time - you get to pick your damn sacrifice, you don’t get to ignore sacrifice as you will make one whether you want to or not**

* 2:10:00 - on the culture of old infants - universities facilitate it by enabling you to go to university to not be something - they rob you future self with debts, to provide you the illusion of an identity - it is pleasure island

* 2:12:00 - on the culture of old infants - technology also complicates this, as before the rough patch use to be 15-18, now it is 18-25 - before the hippies would complain about having to work at a corporation and then get a pension - at least they had jobs! - **there is now a void in our culture due to technology and whatnot that facilitates the adolescents journey to adulthood - how to fix this?**

* 2:13:00 - when you go to university, you should learn 3 things - how to speak, how to think, how to write - that's what the humanities are for, they are meant to make you deadly, in a complex job you will dominate it, in any complex job

* 2:14:45 - the students are saying they are not learning a damn thing in law, it is all social justice nonsense -** it'll do them in anyways, as lawyers are being replaced by automation - **a lot of what they do is dig up information

* 2:15:45 - on the culture of old infants - people don't have to be married to have sex - horrible accounting of lower-class single mothers

* **2:17:00 - the best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them how to write**

    * **<< perhaps this is why good programmers dominate >>**

    * **marking should be about ****_teaching_**** people what they did wrong****_ and how_**** to address it - ****_there is no difference between writing and thinking - good thinking/writing/speaking makes you win the battles you undertake - it is the most powerful weapon you can possibly provide someone with - if you can formulate your arguments coherently, formulate a presentation, and speak to people, lay out a proposal, people give you money, opportunities, influence - teach people to be articulate, it is the most dangerous thing you can possibly be - it is your sword and your bullet proof vest _****- it is like there is a conspiracy to bring people into the education system to make them weaker, perhaps it is because it keeps the competition down, if your students are stupid they won't be able to challenge you**

* **2:22:00 - divorce, with kids, is like having non-fatal cancer - bad stepdads **

    * << dangers of dating a supermodel, Stefan Molyneux -[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBanEZ2GGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBanEZ2GGI) and truth about sex -[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um3EmS9DKsI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um3EmS9DKsI)  >>

* 2:23:00 - one of the things you have when you age is the continuity of your life

    * << perhaps this is why I have such an enticing story on[ balupton.com](http://balupton.com) >>

# [2017 Maps of Meaning #5](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-5/26/1)

## @balupton

* 1:00 - there is more of everything else than us, so we are incapable of perceiving everything, and thus must simplify the world in order to not be overwhelmed and to be functional

* 2:00 - the world is about acting in the world, rather than about perceiving the world - this is a critical difference

* 26:00 - you don't see the anomaly unless it upsets your current pursuit

* 27:00 - the value structure that you inhabit determines what you see, not what you expect or want - no one expected this

* 27:30 - you see only the tiny amount of information necessary for you to plot the next tiny sequence of movements

* **29:00 - ultimate values (things you may not even be aware of) trickle down to your entire hierarchy of goal supersets - as such it is very difficult to identity and specify the meaning level**

* 33:00 - the brain circuits designed for handling exceptions (predators) are the same circuits that fire when your computer crashes and you curse and hit it, hence why people have tourettes syndrome

* 35:50 - what we seem to do is to look at things at the simplest level of analysis of what actually functions - when you interact with the computer, you don't interact with the CPU or electrical power but the keyboard and the screen - as long as the computer is working, it is simple and your stupid conceptions are perfectly fine for getting the job done - when it stops working it becomes a complicated object we don’t understand

* 36:00 - the world is made up of socio-economic-political aspects that hopefully keep broken things fixed so we can use fixed things to fix other things - which is an extraordinary complicated system we take for granted - a system that allows us to default to simplest level that allows us to get to the next step <<< this is all also applicable to printed images and text, and the computer screen, the image is a bunch of dots, but we don't see the dots, we see what they represent to us

* **38:00 - Peterson has found a way to make psychology the best and wisest philosophy**

* 39:00 - people high with anxiety and depression and neuroticism, cannot bind anomalies so when they occur they propagate up the system of meaning to the highest order of conceptualisations (60 *beck?* depression range - everything that happens will cause suicidal thoughts, even positive things)

* 39:40 - psychoanalyst question - why don't you fall into a state of catastrophic evaluation whenever something little goes wrong?

* 41:00 - political problems may be the highest conception of a trivial problem - you should use the level of conception that is closest to the problem - we are driven to use the simplest tool we can to fix the problem (with the minimal time and effort - as we have limited time and resources, it makes sense for us to conserve them) - if you argue with someone, you should argue about the smallest possible thing that might fix the problem, you want to really specify it, what is going on at a micro level, and what is the minimum required for me to be satisfied with the outcome - how can I minimally be bothered by this, and what is the tiniest amount of needed change that would satisfy me, because otherwise the argument would become unglued and escalate to breakdown because you cannot solve a problem

* 44:00 - thing in itself - philosophical concept

* 45:00 - we are also limited in our perceptions of others by their willingness to act in accordance to my expectations while we are together (as they could be doing anything while we are not together) - this is politeness - you understand the game, you play the game, and you don't scare others away - *this is a productive and uncommon definition of politeness…?*

* **46:00 - if you understand the game, you don't have to be nervous as you understand what you need to do to get what you want - this is why people have a desire to maintain their culture - because it means everyone knows the game and is playing it so that no one needs to get upset - a culture is only secondary a belief system, it is primarily a game that we are engaging in - you don’t even need the beliefs or understanding of beliefs to play the game - this is how non-human animals get along**

* 49:00 - when you look at something, what you see depends also on what you want to use it for - people and objects and all things this applies to (again at 53:50)

* **49:40 - what we want is good ****functional**** simplifications**

    * **<< reminds me of Shawn Achor's "selecting the most beneficial reality for our worldview"** >>

    * << this field is FASCINATING - I've never felt this for programming… >>

* 51:00 - Naomi Klein movie which was bad -** ideology can suppress our ability to perceive things outside of it - there are facts, and you let those that pass your filter through, but what about all the facts outside your filter that you don't let through!**

* **54:30 - how words work - we compress cognitive symbols into verbal objects that others then decompress hopefully into the same cognitive symbols**

* 56:15 - this seems to be the Richard Dawkins vs ken ham debate - which ken struggled with but made the same arguments as Peterson here, which Dawkins didn't like - which seems why Peterson doesn’t like Dawkins - and the Peterson vs Harris debate

* 58:00 - scientists operate within a little time domain in which they are capable of being a scientist

    * << reminds me of my criticism of Myles >>

* 1:03:00 - science answers "what the world is made of", stories answers “how to act in the world” - there is no reason to believe those two questions can be answered using the same approach

* **1:04:00 - your mental health is dependent on a value system**

    * << Christopher Howard's breakdown that affected my billionaire bootcamp >>

    * << borderline personality disorder >>

* 1:05:00 - "what does it matter what I do, in a thousand years it will be irrelevant" - stupid but true - stupid as it is just a game, and one can take any game and find a context in which it is irrelevant -** ****(?what is “it” in “it is just a game”?)** - prefer a useful/relevant frame of reference, not specifically what you derive from it

* 1:07:00 - music and stories are the two things, of an intellectual nature, in which it seems, everyone is drawn to

* 1:09:00

    * <<  it is more than just foraging for useful information - as then you are just a machine absorbing information, and that is not a job >>>

    * **you must also test that information with your actions in your life, to discover what is true, and build your castle to see how correct that information is**

    * << consciously is when we know how to articulate it, unconsciously is when we act out the patterns >>

* 1:10:00 - the death problem is a subset of the complexity problem, because sometimes complexity is so strong that it causes suffering because it is untamed and in those circumstances people prefer death via suicide to make the unfathomable complexity go away - this can happen reasonably if you are hit by 3 or 4 catastrophes at the same time - someone you love dies, you get cancer, the political system falls, and you lose your job - pretty much everything that happened to me, except the cancer part

* 1:12:00 - people blow out from complexity in the same way a balloon breaks at the weakest point

    * << my weakest point has been Trichotillomania to not be great to please others >>

    * it's almost always a complexity related phenomena rather than a mental illness related phenomena (as in the cause)

* 1:14:00 - walls are practical because they stop complexity from getting in and ruining you from the inside (metaphor that expands to different levels)

* 1:15:00 - openness/conscientiousness for liberals and conservatives explained in detail <- low openness have a disgust thing, because they put everything into boxes, have it all separate, when two things touch, they issue disgust

* 1:20:00 - and earlier - discrimination is morally wanted because "you get to say no to me, if I get to say no to you"

* 1:22:00 - rooms are setup in ways that tell us how to act in them >> try doing work in a pub, it won't work

* 1:23:00 - openness discusses everything, low-oneness stays within a small subset of things

* 1:23:00 - simplification against chaos is a common theme here, where simplification seems to be our constant unshakable urge to everything in life

* 1:28:00

    * << WOAH, STUDY THIS MORE - like the Daniel Defoe book >>

* 1:29:00 - on brain is dispersed throughout the body

    * << this seems to be a statement about death, that in a beheading we split the person into two brains, the head brain loses consciousness quickly, but the body brain writhes in pain - so there are now two persons - both alive - but it seems that what we consider death, is death of what we value - because when we ourselves lose a finger, we say we lost part of ourselves, we also say this about our character - when someone goes into a coma we pull the plug as they stop representing what we value, despite even if they are dead, their body is still alive - their fingernails still grow for a long time - so it seems entities innately value what makes an entity valuable, and when that value is no longer recognisable they are dead - even in the expression "you are dead to me" seems to go into this - how this relates to the death vs complexity thing is a really interesting question - touches on this at 1:31:00 just around >>

* 1:34:00 - intelligence and conscientiousness have zero correlation, unlike openness which has a positive correlation with intelligence - which is strange, as what we associate with intelligence is what we also associate with conscientiousness - dream thinking is stronger than day thinking as dream thinking you need a sedative in order not to act it out!

* 1:37:30

    * **"if something bad happened to me, I must have done something to deserve it"**

        * this thought pattern is especially true in conscientious people

    * when they didn't deserve it, it can have them spin out of control in spiral thought patterns trying to find out what it is, or blaming something of themselves that had no correlation

    * << **Trichotillomania!** >>

    * << seems myself is super high on consciousness and openness >>

    * Peterson: this is a useful trait, as it suggests there are things about yourself that you can change to make the future better

    * << this makes me recall my belief that I had until a certain incident that "everything in the world is something that I have a responsibility and obligation to fix because I can change it - that everything is my fault because I can change everything" -- that incident in my life was a situation where a catastrophe happened to me, but it wasn't my fault, but I blamed myself to see what I could do better - and it took me 2.5 years until I realised that people are independent, I’m my own person, and people can harm themselves with their own thoughts and the words of others even if those things are benign to anyone else >>

    * Peterson: the common treatment for PTSD from such thought patterns is situational analysis

    * Peterson: 80 million snakes all at the same time

    * << I think this is reasonable providing you can believe and have had successes in your life to indicate you can deal with 80 million snakes, that you believe you can, makes it a manageable chaos, as I believed that for 24 years with great renown success >> 

* 1:39:00 - incompatible temperaments are rarely solvable - especially high conscientiousness and low conscientiousness - one provides stability through sacrifice and the other couldn't care less

* 1:42:00 - lack of curiosity occurs once we have built what we consider an adequate representation of the thing

* 1:59:00< - ~it seems that emotions and motivations are driven sub-personalities, that have goals, and uses what we refer to as motivations and emotions to regulate those goals, and at times different sub-personalities take control, and the question of when and how one decides to interrupt another and take control is an open question

    * << this seems to relate into my goal setting into batches of tasks rather than tasks >>

* 2:01:00 - okay ^ -> "motivation sets frame - not goals, not drives, not reflexes - includes goals, emotions, perceptions, actions", “emotions track progress - ahead - stop, back”

* ^ these are interesting, as it is like that saying "which wolf do you wish to feed?" - “which sub-personality do you wish to practice/grow?”

* 2:05:30 - are you angry at your partner or do you want sexual relations more? - which takes control is up to which sub-personality (?needs?) is stronger at that time - the rest of of our brain beyond the hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of our sub-personalities

* 2:08:00 - islands of stability implanted in your child is essential for their development of regulation of underlying sub-personalities / emotional systems - perhaps an issue with autistic meltdowns

* 2:11:00 - if you constantly see things that make you miserable and unhappy - then perhaps you need to ask if your goals are proper - as your goals determine what you perceive

* 11:00 - soviets used victimisation to fail at harvesting and kill millions of people

* 23:00 - incentive reward (enthusiasm and analgesic) vs consumerist reward (satiated and temporary) - analgesic suppresses negative emotion

* 29:00 - criticism of hedonism vs conscientiousness - no point being conscientious is stable societies, as variations kill them

* 33:18 - it might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you, is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you are willing to take on

* 36:30 - it doesn't matter what he is saying is incoherent and doesn’t make much sense - what he is selling is easy to buy, so Pinocchio buys it

* 37:00 - shedding responsibility by finding excuses in things that were once innocent - sickness - **you never ever want to use sickness/anything as an excuse for not doing what you wanted to do** - as it will muddy the waters of responsibility and screw you

* 45:55 - always ask yourself when there is someone you dislike or even like, what would have been the circumstances that must have befallen them that made their current state a necessary part of them - if someone is cynical, think about what circumstances must have caused the cynicism - if someone is enthusiastic, think about the circumstances that has caused it and lead to the establishment of that positive action, recognition, and pattern - although there is no direct causal pathway, so it is still speculation, but useful speculation as it is insightful

    * << the **house destruction scene** reminds me of the recent antifa/black-bloc riots >>

* 1:01:00 - as a society degenerations, one has to be offered more and more stupid amusements to prevent them from realising what is going on - bread and circus -there was a part in the previous lecture about the accessibility of entertainment, where the "dumber" the entertainment the greater the size of the audience who will be fond of it - could these two points be related - **where the media is distracting us, rather than enhancing us?﻿**

* 1:03:00 - standing up and proclaiming rules does not work

* 1:11:00 - guy is so naive to his own imperfections he is a totalitarian in training, and he smashes the mirror, the last hope at redemption - destroys his capacity for self-consciousness

* 1:13:00 - sometimes to escape, you have jump into the unknown, which is scary - when you go from a bad place to a better place, you go to a worst place first - that is a great thing to know, as it tells you why you might be unwilling to take the next step

* 1:15:30 - you can't run back into who you are - as you are a new person with new experiences and knowledge

* 1:19:00 - you only become a man once your father dies (which can happen metaphorically)

* 1:21:00 - the answers you look for are never in your parent's home, if you look there, you will get stale like bread that has been around too long

* 1:23:00 - unless you are seeking something, you will not see things related to it

* 1:24:00 - when you are rebuilding the broken pieces of your life, you are looking for the spirit needed to turn the unstable chaotic state in a new stable reality - this fantasy will make new things visible to you to help you on your journey

* 1:30:00 - the more articulate person always rises

* 1:45:00 - old can mean the lack of play - play is needed to do new things that you haven't done before - doing the same things will only last so long, before it becomes no longer fruitful

* 1:49:00 - you need to see the macro problem and the micro problems, and tackle both - if you just see and tackle the micro problem, you are doing busywork and are blind to your journey - if you just see and tackle the macro problem, they you get nothing done and make no progress towards solving it - never lose sight of the macro problem, because ending up lost in a bad place is worse** than stagnating?**

* 1:52:00 - if you are unwilling to admit your insufficiency, then you will not be able to go on the pursuit to get help, ask the question, and seek the change - humility is the antidote to arrogance, as it means you still have something to learn and you are a student, an always honourable thing

* 1:54:00 - benevolence kills innovation, as benevolence is respect and admiration for the way things are - not what they could become > probably why frustration is such a good force for innovation![2017 Maps of Meaning #3](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-3/24/1)

* 15:00 - don't avoid small problems because you know they are there - FACE THEM - because otherwise they will grow into big problems all by themselves - **as a long term strategy avoiding problems is abysmal** - it seems likely in people high in neuroticism and agreeableness - these people are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat

* 17:00 - **negotiation** - if you want something, have 5 arguments for why you want it, and 5 arguments against - because that will wean out what you really want and provide the resilience against adversaries

* **_19:00 - don't practice what you do not want to become - because it will punish the good patterns and reward the bad patterns - making the good patterns weaker and the bad patterns stronger - and this is incredibly difficult to change_**

## @balupton

* 8:00 - interaction operates within the constraints of social expectation, which is based on a cultural map of expectations built into our perceptions, that dictates how we operate - if that mapping, if that social expectation does not coincide, then conflict ensues 

* 11:00 - cultural social expectations are really desires of how people should act - a culture is often willing to fight to the death to preserve their culture because it is the foundations of how people should act to be prosperous

    * << ties into Defoe's Treatise of Marriage book >>

    * cultural conflicts actually does destabilise people

* 12:00 - interesting, that political factions will cause more than just resource conflicts, but conflicts of existential crises due to the conflicts of how people should act

* 19:00 - it's a happy day when the hypothalamus is not telling you what to do - you live in a tranquil state

* 20:00 - low IQ is one of the things that predisposes you to PTSD

* 21:00 - there is nothing more important to our sanity that having our expectations/desires of society match the actions of society (as such one must change their expectations/desires, or change society) otherwise emotions get dysregulated into combat mode

* 26:00 - happiness makes you impulsive, and that is not a good state to be in

* 33:00 - as soon as you get compliance you want to reward that instantly - as it promotes more compliance

* 35:00 - it's very hard to realise when things are going right to reward them, as our survival mechanisms are optimised for detecting threats and eliminating threats

* 37:00 - you must keep your relationship with children pristine, that is to say no grudges, as they do not understand grudges and they change constantly, so a pristine relationship is much better for teaching them through interactions of better ways to be

* 38:00

    * << as someone who was a stepdad, with all those who saw and knew my interactions saying I was a great stepdad, but with myself just feeling I was terrible because I saw all my failings - how does one reconcile that pain? - sure perhaps it is essential that one is aware of their failing to be a better parent than those who are not aware of their failings - however, being aware of your failings produces a cognitive load and emotional burden, and that is not nice to live with, remember, or endure >>

* 39:00 - after 4, it is virtually impossible to rectify anti-social behaviours in children - between 2 and 4 your goal should be to raise your child to be a functional piece of unity, such that they can devote themselves to an altruistic goal for a reasonable length of time - integrating their emotions and motivations together under social influence

* 41:00 - the point of tea parties, playing, games, and nursing

* 46:00 - competition requires cooperation, as one competes with the social constraints of rules, which is society - a hockey game is a competition of two teams which cooperate together to follow the rules of the game

* 49:00 - winning is being invited to play all the games, because you are a good player - who excels at competition to accomplish/envy and cooperation to assist/idol

* 55:00 - no goal, no positive emotion, because positive emotion is the movement towards a goal, and if there is no goal, there is there is no movement towards a goal, so there is no positive emotion

* **_55:30 - a goal should ideally be a goal that others wish to help you on, and which helps you accomplish other goals, and which help teaches you how to accomplish other goals - you may be able to find through evaluation these factors within any goal_**

* 58:00 - you set a goal to accomplish the goal to be able to get a better goal - this process provides your life with meaning, it is the only process that does - other things that provide meaning are forms of this process - the trick is to figure out what is a really good goal

* 1:04:00 - that's life - life is a hydra, snakes everywhere, you cut one off, seven more grow <- solution, well what could you do about that? loaded question, as it provides the presupposition you can do something about that, returning control - by confronting the chaos, you get stronger, and you grow your shield - if you run from the snakes, the snakes grow and get bigger, and that is not a solution to life as there reaches a point where there is no recovery

* 1:11:00 - to conquer the dragon you must acknowledge, identify, understand, and hone the part of you that is monstrous, so you can use it conquer demons

    * << this seems dangerous, as it could lead to monstrous actions with any self-justified delusion >>

* 1:11:30 - if you are a monster but you chose not to be a monster or use your monstrosity for good - you become virtuous (more or less the notion of the movie Suicide Squad) - the harmless are not virtuous, they are just harmless (what about Ghandi… he had plenty of courage, and is considered quite virtuous)

* 1:38:00 - there are always opportunities for elevating your sights within your capabilities for wherever you happen to be

* 1:40:00 - if you are honest then reality is on your side - if you are deceitful then you are fighting reality and it will smash you back to the extent of your lies

* 1:45:00 - what the hell is the conscience (sometimes it is a voice, sometimes it is a feeling, sometimes it is neither!) - a Freudian perspective is it is an instantiation of society within your mind

* 1:49:00 - you can at least know what you shouldn't be doing, and if you stop doing those things, things will get better - what things should I stop doing, which I could stop, and would stop, that will make my life better

* 1:56:00 - your conscious is not omnipresent, if it was, you could just do everything it said and be sorted - however your conscious like yourself is something you grow with and converse with over your life to develop into a more developed person

* 1:58:00 - you are a marionette/puppet of your culture - but hopefully you can become more than that, in a wise way, and not a puppet of another system but a strong independent person with good roots in reality who cooperates with others and competes within systems of reality

* 1:59:00 - **you are a product of culture and nature, however you are also a product of YOU - the hero determines their own character, they become who they want to be, not forced to be it or resign to it, someone else does not determine it for them**

* 2:19:00 - values and conscious rules often have conflicts - this is very difficult to navigate

* 1:17:00 The image of the father virgin mother and son has been around for thousands of years prior to Christianity. 

    * So where does it start? Does it just begin as an idea that makes itself come true via it's spreading out into the world and then bouncing back into manifestation. Do we really have that power within us to make archetypes real? Or is it an absolute truth that we happened to recognize in a very low resolution form millions ago and we have just been refining our understanding of it as time goes on? Is there a third option?

    * The writing is very obscure, hard to manage because it's like reading a detailed info dump without any actual specific details. Just gigantic abstracts to deal with. Hard to get through very much at a time.

* **1:30:00 To have ultimately meaningful life means to adopt ultimate responsibility.**

    * Jesus did just that, taking all sins committed not by himself in as his own burden to cleanse us of guilt, so that we can move forward. Without the innocent/virgin sacrifice humanity would be cursed to destruction for our mistakes.  Story of David's son dying because of lusting after Bathsheba. Gen. 50:20. What was done out of evil was turned to good (khan, Hitler, Stalin) That's what evolution is, humans standing on top of the bodies of trillions of beings that came before us. We have a responsibility to their sacrifice to take humanity to a point where infinite amounts of sacrifice can be "justefied": infinite capability. God.

* 1:40:00 Faith and wisdom are feminine 

    * Because women make man self conscious

* 1:42:00 **Belief is acting out your ideas.**

    * Book of James

* 2:01:00 

    * This touches on a point I had considered previously. In a deterministic world with our ability to be conscious, you can see your past and follow it's thread into the future, deterministically, and decide, based off that self recognition, to REdetermine your new outcome. It seems to not quite be free will and not quite determinism.

* 2:19:00 The world's too complicated to just live life by 5 rules.

    * << Hahahaha. For Peterson's generation it was a "real threat" of nuclear holocaust but for my generation (and for me too) the threat seems to be imaginary.  I mean getting upset over no. of likes you get on social media or catastrophizing.>>

* 1:00 - JBP worried about nuclear war ?

    * << Why JBP is so worried about nuclear holocaust. He admits in his book (Maps of Meaning) other people he saw around him went about their daily business just fine so why was he so hot and bothered about it ? This is important because if you read Maps of Meaning it's very clear that it’s his distress over this issue that caused him to follow the path he followed and it became kind of his life’s work. All because of his so called "genuine worry". It makes you wonder was it the “Muse” or something divine that caused him to be distressed like that or christ suffering for the good of people. Please understand Peterson is the one guy who could make something out of that suffering. Intention is not enough - I got all the intention in the world. He had something else too - not sure if I should call it talent or something else (really high IQ ?).>>

* 1:30 - Went down to Arizona to see decommissioned ICBM missile silo.

    * << Wow man, you are scared to death of this stuff and you want to go and actually look at it. Something to be said about facing your demons. >>

* 2:31 - It was decommissioned under "Reagan".

    * << Why did all of a sudden he feel the need to point that out explicitly ? >>

* 5:04 - Keys were in once (in the launch panel of nuclear silo).

    * << I just find it hard to believe every time this comes up, that this world came really close to all out nuclear war, that we would be willing to destroy everything like that. How do you even imagine something like that ? >>sufferin

    * << Movie mentioned: "The day after". Will watch it when I get free time. >>

* 5:31 - "The day after" influenced Reagan to seek peace.

    * << wow, that's interesting. A movie can shape International politics and in this case future of the world. Again the same point about how movies/drama can influence change in a positive way. >>

* 6:46 - Communists and utopian nature of their philosophy

    * << This is exact opposite of what they teach in India during meditation - accept the reality for what it is and deal with it with an equanimous mind. Not losing your mind when you fall and not getting excited when you succeed. Be aware. If you can do that you will have utopia inside yourself only. >>

* 7:21 - From each according to his ability to each according to his need. Every other system produces income equality. Pareto distribution. 

    * << Why would you want to take someone else's money as a default policy for yourself and your family ? And if you are going to do this what are you going to do with your free time if you are not working ? I know how tough it is to do higher level work (Knowledge work) because of "[Resistance](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)". I know I fail so many time, at least works keeps you grounded and helps you maintain a schedule. People who don’t have that and have lot of free money in their hands end up falling for all kinds of addictions.>>

* 09:00 - The trick with money game is zero. Once you hit zero, you are done.

    * << I wonder how many times we could have hit zero in life and someone (some friend, some author, some idea) saved us, at times even luck or what seemed to be divine intervention. Help showing up out of no-where. Kind of reminds me of that book "The Alchemist".>>

* 09:17 - At times you are headed for zero even if you have some resources left. You know when you are doomed.

    * << And I think this is when growth happens. So many people including me only get their asses moving and fix chronic characters problems when they figure out they are headed for doom or to use his Bible terminology "The flood" is coming. What happens to this growth attitude when crisis is averted (in reality or as you see it) ? Well it goes away, and process of continuous self improvement stops for so many folks until next time. Reminds me of an Indian verse attribute to Kabir : [“In anguish everyone prays to Him, in joy does none. To One who prays in happiness, how can sorrow come.”](http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=DohaDetails&DohaID=14)>>

* 10:36 - 1% having most of wealth happens to every society that has been studied regardless of the governmental system.

    * << Wow, try telling that to our progressive friends who want to redistribute the wealth. >>

* 10:41 - A lot of people had zero in Soviet Union so they just died.

    * << A point about trust. A society with little trust and where people hate each other this can happen where you let your fellow citizens die. But as much demonized religion might be it does bring a lot of charitable deeds.>>

* 10:58 - Very hard to fight against Pareto distribution pattern.

    * << Reminds me of a point Rush Limbaugh keeps making about how progressives keep fighting human nature. >>

* 10:17 - Pareto distribution just doesn't apply to wealth, it also applies to books. Million english books published, 500 of them sold more than 100,000 copies. One of them was by Stephen King and he took half the money.

    * << ROFL>>

* 12:09 - Success breeds success, and failure breeds failure.

    * << He really had to say that, kind of hard to digest when you are not doing too well but it's more true than not in my experience unless you use the failure to push even harder.>>

* 12:29 - Every man has a threshold for violence.

    * << I live in India and if you watch the traffic over here, that threshold seems pretty low man. >>

* 12:46 - Status is important to man because it makes them marketable to women.

    * << ok. >>

* 15:21 - Pareto distribution applies to everything people produce.

    * << Kind of reminds me of this idea in computer programming that a program spends 80% of its time executing 20% of the code. >>

* 15:35 - Almost everything fails and few things succeed beyond wildest imagination.

    * << Now that I am sitting here typing this, my ancestors managed to somehow not fail I guess. >>

* 18:16 - Poverty is caused by lack of money is a stupid idea.

    * << Today with even rural areas getting access to the Internet, I would say it's even more stupid. Because even they can now access a lot of this world’s information and learn from it. Assumption is more you know, more money you can make.>>

* 20:25 - Raising IQ is next to impossible.

    * << So, what does this mean for me ? I have always thought that you can improve your intelligence by working hard and pushing it. I just don't believe him. I think there has got to be a way. There has got to be a way.>>

* 21:02 - 115 is like the minimum you ought to have and if you have an IQ of 145 you can do whatever you want.

    * << So if I want to achieve things and my IQ is not compatible with that, does that mean I am pretty much FUBAR? I won't ever make it ? >>

* 23:39 - Harder to get a volunteer job than a real job.

    * << Another one of the things about a western country that I don't get. Why they are doing this ? One would think you would want to make it easy so that more people can volunteer. In my country you can sign up left and right, I don’t think they even ask you for your ID at times. >>

* 26:13 - The charity decided to fire this guy just because he couldn't fold the damn envelops, he had IQ of 80.

    * << Christ, makes me want to re-evaluate my own life and realize how grateful I am, that guy went through all that. No fault of his own. Boy low IQ can really kill ya. Well at least this story has a happy ending because that guy finally got a job training dogs. >>

* 27:58 - Different theories about inequality and why it exists led to cold war.

* 29:35 - People aren't taught about all those people died in communist Russia (30 million b/w 1919-1959).

    * << Why ? >>

* 30:23 - In Russia a couple selling body parts for food.

    * << How come I am 27 years old and didn't hear about it till now ? Am I that ignorant or societies have decided to swept it under the rug so you won’t know unless you are looking ?>>

* **30:41 - When I learn someone has done something terrible, I try to imagine what kind of situation I would have to find myself in to do that ?**

    * << A good life advice I might add. >>

* **31:22 - You get enlightened by doing things that are really really necessary but you don't want to do.**

    * << Do I really need to say anything here ? What a remarkable statement ! >>

* 32:59 - Highly functional society where infrastructure always works is a miracle.

    * << Ya I live in India and somethings water is not there, electricity goes away. There is garbage on the streets. These things don't kill you exactly but they make your daily reality painful and prevent you from focusing on higher goals or knowledge goals. When I  got to work, I am risking my well being during the commute because of people who don’t follow the traffic rules (I doubt if they know there is such a thing), it puts you in fight-flight situation for no good reason. Kind of makes it hard to relax.>>

* 34:51 - Being poor is the natural state. Westerral world and Russia took two different paths.

    * << John Locke, James Stuart Mill's ideas are the ones on which West is based. I should read about them some day. >>

* 36:51 - Dallas was the most popular show in East Germany.

* 39:27 - 10s of thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at each other during cold war.

    * << Interesting how humans were ready to end everything because of ideology. >>

* 42:04 - Why do people value something? How can someone believe something so much that they would risk their own death to protect it or death of other people ?

* 44:30 - Difference between knowing where you are and not  knowing where you are?

    * "The distinction between the territory that you have mastered and the territory you haven't mastered is a fundamental distinction. It’s the distinction between home and the strange land."<< @leabstrait The distinction between order and chaos, meaning and nihilism, being the prey of some unknown predator.>> 

* 49:51 - You might decide to take the troublemaker down, but you would be an exception.

    * << I can relate to this, how have seen many bad things happen and also saw my colleagues couldn't care less even though they were happening in physical proximity. So, the guy who intervenes become the odd one out and it’s not an easy place to be. >>

* 50:14 - Belief systems regulate emotions but not directly. When you have a theory about the world and other people have the same theory and they act out on that theory. You both get what you want.

    * << What happens when you are in a system where your theory is vastly different from others ? You will be at conflict all the time. >>

* 51:53 - When other people's behaviour don’t match your theory whole model falls apart. It’s very destabilizing to the society.

    * << Maybe increasing tolerance of change would help ? >>

* 52:51 - You can't look at anything without any hierarchy of values.

    * << One issue I have seen is when you run into people who have different values hence they value/perceive different things, they automatically start converting you or bothering you just because you are different. They just can't sit there and enjoy the difference e.g. while growing up many people I knew just couldn’t understand why anyone would want to sit and study instead of partying. They try to put enormous pressure on you to behave just like them. Even now as an adult when other people are sitting in a group drinking/enjoying and you are walking by - telling them you don’t drink offends the hell out of them. They are like what’s wrong with you ? Why aren't you joining us (even though they don’t explicitly say it). Looks like we are always acting out this war of belief systems on a micro level in the society all the time. They believe in having a good time and not bothering yourself with depth, having drinks at night. Making jokes, sharing stories what he/she did. I believe in learning something useful so that I can actually improve my life. I would much rather study books, or watch a JBP lecture. What’s interesting is that I have nothing to do with these people, I couldn’t care any less what they were doing as long as the music is not so loud but why do they bother with changing me ? Is it arrogance (Why is this guy not joining our group ? How dare he insults us ?) ? or they are just not that tolerant of individual differences ?>>

* 56:30 - You are sitting here listening to me because you value doing well in life (getting degree, getting a job, and having a family later on).

    * << Is that why they are listening to the professor ? What explains the situation where a person knows what is good or what he should do and don't do it e.g. at work. The person still wants a better future but can’t act out in a way that will bring that about. At other times you are so fed up that you don’t want to do anything, even eat. So what explains that ? You are certainly not helping yourself by starving I assume.>>

* 56:47 - Dan Simon experiment at a counter. People don't notice the clerk at the store change because it doesn’t matter as long as the entity acts like a clerk.

    * << Reminds me of the book "Games people play". >>

*  57:57 - You have values that you don't know because you don’t know yourself that well.

    * << So, I am running around acting and perceiving things because of this unknown belief system. So much for being in control. Sometimes it happens that you encounter a situation and behave in a certain way that surprises you. You never knew you had it in you. This can manifest in a negative way also, where you think you are a good person but you end up doing some harm.>>

* 58:27 - The more integrated you are the more control you have. You are a loose collection of arguing sub-personalities and they are directed towards a single goal (more or less depending upon how many contradictions you have managed to resolve).

* 59:48 - You are not required to believe what I am telling you, if you have a different argument follow that sucker.

    * << It's interesting that he is saying that when so much of western culture is purely developed to making other people comply with latest developments in culture like the gender pronouns issue. Those people have no concept of tolerance and enjoying the differences knowing it’s ok to differ.>>

* 1:00:25 - A shared belief keeps your emotions under control. David Hume's idea that you cannot derive an ought from an is. What this means is that merely knowing basic facts about something doesn’t mean you are able to implement them in your life. There is a gap. Science takes the subjectivity out of perception. I don’t believe you can create morality from Science.

    * << Ya I have believed Science has all the answers for quite some time, recently from my own experience I am beginning to differ. >>

* 1:02:57 - If everything is of equal importance than you are paralyzed. Truism - A wedge in the middle of the society in the sense that moral systems that we use to unite us has been subject to intense critique from the Scientists. Pretty effective critique. That's a problem. The problem of how you should act ? **Nietzsche ****said we are still running on the fumes of christianity. **Even convicted felons have something divine in them. Presumption of innocence until proven guilty.

    * << So, lots of things I admire about the west came from Christianity. Cool. Hell I am all for beheading rapist and stuff - this whole thing about innocent until proven guilty is a big deal. It's not default.  >>

* 1:05:57 - Societies that give more power to the individual in a framework of laws seem to work better. Natural rights come from metaphysical beliefs. If you take out the metaphysical belief. Eventually it will fall.

* 1:07:16 - Western society has oscillated since 1800s from extreme right to extreme left. Democracies managing to stay in the middle. That cannot be maintained without the underlying metaphysics.

* 1:07:56 - There is more that one kind of truth, pragmatic truth. It's deeper than scientific truth. These truths help you stay alive.

    * << >>8

* 1:09:48 - Camille Paglia, classic modern feminists. She is influenced by the same book JBP is influenced by. "The origins and History of Consciousness" by Erich Neumann. Other authors: Joseph Campbell, and Mircea Eliade.

    * << Let's add that to reading list >>

* 1:11:30 - Humans being have an innate build in narrative. Narrative is the dramatic expression of necessary system of human values.

    * << What does this mean ? >>

* 1:11:45 - The proper goal of coming to university and studying humanities is not to do premature criticism of something you don't even yet understand. Learn as much as you can about poetry, drama, religion, literature, music etc….Why music helps get through stuff ?

    * << Ok professor. I have done premature criticism of religion, I have seen recently that it was incorrect thing to do. That takes me to this idea that came up in Biblical lecture #1 group meeting. Someone pointed out I didn't take something seriously because I didn’t like the package. I have a colleague who recently taught me to process information in such a way as you ignore repulsive things and focus on the value you can gain from parts that are  good. So, not to throw away the whole things just because some parts are bad. It requires practice and cultivation but I think it’s pretty useful idea.  >>

* 1:12:54 - When you grow older your favourite music would be the music you listened b/w 16-20.

    * << Interesting. >>

*  1:13:50 - Great dramas are more real than real. So they are hyper real. They give you abstract lessons.

    * << That's really interesting, it would be kind of hard to have a lesson for every out of millions of situations you can encounter. Instead you come up with a general framework of behaving and refine it over time. Is that what religious text is all about ?

* <20:00 - tyrannical woman power

* 25:00 - socialists/communists believe money solves everything, it is just in the wrong hands - it doesn't

* 29:00 - marriage vs sexual predation vs STIs - sexuality puts the needs of the species higher than the needs of the individual - this is a very bad idea

* 35:00 - personality and predatory types (Criminals) and parasite types (SJWs) - empathy protects those you are empathetic towards and violent towards those you are not

* 40:00 - political factions

* **44:00 - what the west has done is subordinate group identity to the nobility of the individual **- this is a brilliant idea, as it says the group is important, but it is subordinate to the individual, **it took us thousands of years to come up with that, to create stable societies **- Jung was the first to pose that human life depends on the nobility of the individual - this is the central religious statement of western culture

* **46:00 - Stefan: when you build a multiplicity of meaning as an individual, then your own meaning as an individual is more than enough, and you no longer need group identity to thrive or find meaning**

* 46:00 - Peterson: if people shouldered enough responsibility, the question of meaning vanishes - if you want to set the world right, look for things in your own home, that bugs you that you can set right, then set it right - pick things that you can see what is wrong, and you can fix it yourself, as an individual - and as you go about fixing it, document what you think can happen, and what does happen -** if you just fix the tenable problems in your own vicinity and agency on your level, then your life will become so meaningful you won't even be able to stand it, and almost immediately**

* **48:00 - if your doubt is not serving your usefulness, you probably want to question your doubt**

* 49:00 - the nuremberg trial / Hannah Arendt / was the most important discovery of the 20th century

* 50:00 - Stefan: everything is built and created by people who have rejected the concept of meaningless (Jordan: this is the everyday heroism that is everywhere if you are open to it) - if you sit and wallow about meaningless you are praying on everyone else's opposite perspective as regards to meaning

* 52:00 - one of the things that our culture doesn't do very well, is teach people when they are doing the right things / doing things right - cake gives us intrinsic rewards through biological functions, intellectual pursuits are a lot harder and also require peer praise

* **53:00 - people are not good at criticising their own doubts - just because it is negative, doesn't mean it is true!**

* **54:00 - one of the other things I'll do is make people realise the power their speech has over them - sometimes you will say things to yourself that make you feel amazing and other times you will say things that make you feel weak and falling apart - think and grow rich - detaching yourself from the voices in your head can be incredibly useful - Jung described the processes of antithesis and synthesis, that is I’m a house which many conflicting sub-personalities constantly live, and as such how do I make them live in peace with each other, how do I criticise them**

* 57:00 - when you utter things that make you feel like you are standing on firm ground, that might be the real you speaking - when I first started doing that, I was shocked at how much I was saying had nothing to do with me (it didn't make me feel on firm ground)

* **58:30 - Stefan: trading christianity for the state is a diminishing of free will, as in christianity you are allowed free will**

* 1:03:00 - we can no longer get by in the modern world without the ability to articulate what we mean, we can no longer just act it out

* 1:05:00 - if you believe Dawkins and Harris, then everyone who isn't scientific is stupid and barbaric - no, people have been smart and strong and tough and moral without science for a very long time, thanks to the role of religion - this seems very true, as the older the book I read, the wiser they are

* 1:05:30 - humans are the species that conquests the unknown - that is us - that is who we are

    * << what? this is amazing, emotions didn't exist cognitively until someone invented an understanding of them - perhaps the higher the abstraction the more difficult it is to recognise/invent/articulate/explain/publicise/adopt - probably why hippies harp on about love, even though it is a meaningless phrase, it is one they can identify with for lack of better higher cognitive words >>

* 1:13:00 - part of your goal in life is to recognise tragedy and to minimise it - if you are resentful, then you are the main character of tragedy - we should do what we can to dispense with unnecessary suffering

* 1:18:00 - the liberation of your suffering being your fault is that now you can do something about your suffering - victims lose that responsibility - the white male thing victimises, however white males can tune out and get on with their life - the world is infinitely complex and the white male hate mob is a resentful island in there, just tune out and go to a different island** - get rid of your pointless suffering!**

* 1:19:00 - instead of focusing on day to day things, focus on the highest good you can possibly conceive of, and then speak and live in that truth - seems like every SJW does this though, and it seems like it goes against the get your house in order advice earlier - I'm sure there is a way to communicate the truth in that message better, but that was not it.

* 1:21:00 - Stefan: it seems to me people in this modern age are wanting to outsource the conscious to an external entity/bureaucracy - Peterson: yep because half the archetype is missing!

    * << this seems to be a criticism of Sam Harris's as well as the AI push for ethical machines - when our cars are making, and will need to make, the decisions about who to kill in an unavoidable accident, this outsourcing of conscious seems to reach a point where is there a place for human conscious left? - it seems not  >>

* **1:26:30 - the eye of Horus was worshipped, because it gave agency to the people in that they are divine and have the potential to improve things with their agency** - and if people don't act that way, if they don’t live up to their potential, then you get mad at them, because they are not acting as a responsible conscious individual - the radical types are always trying to get rid of individual consciousness - **whereas consciousness is the mystery of how one actualises their potential to transform reality through the power of their decisions which alter the structure of reality - think and grow rich**

# f[Psychology as a Career](https://youtu.be/AYhAz9k008Q)

## @balupton

CWhen planning a career, it is important to understand and learn how to tolerate never being done. No matter how much you work, it is not enough.

Humans are not happy generally speaking unless we are carrying a burden of responsibility, as it makes you worth something.

When you do your applications, specify who you are, sell them on you - not what you want to do, as that will probably change by the time you complete your degree.

You need to be able to distinguish between costs and investments. If you get your acceptance letter, it is worth $7,000,000 dollars over your life.

What does success mean? What if you want to have a good life?

1. Do what other people do, unless you have a really good reason not to, so what do other people do:

2. Have friends, and really good friends

3. Have an intimate relationship that is stable over time - without that, you are kind of chaotic and lost, plus without that, you only have your brain - with that, you now have two brains, you are twice as wise - when you pair up, you should pair up where your strengths cover their weaknesses and their strengthens cover your weaknesses, so you become a complete strong unit - and you are foolish not to have children, women may not want children when they are in their 20s, but they become desperate for children at 30, and it kicks in about 28, so expect that and plan for that - daycare doesn't work, nannies may work - you have design your life to accomplish both of those two difficult things (career and family)

What to get yourself the edge?

1. IQ - physical exercise is the best way to maintain your IQ, it starts to diminish after 24 - get your drug and alcohol use under control, as that will deteriorate your IQ quicker

2. Think about your typical day, how much time is wasted? Wasted time is when the time you spent is the time you haven't planned to do. It is distractions.

3. What is your time worth? Apply money to it, it is how we measure worth. Your time is worth your earning potential. Because what you do now should contribute to what you earn in the future. So it is compounded interest.

4. Half your time trying to concentrate and double your discipline.

5. How hard would you be working if someone pulled out a gun to your head?

6. What effort % are you working at? Think of what you can do to do this task faster, with more effort, with more discipline, with more reward.

7. Got to be ruthless to be efficient. And efficient people win.

8. A profitable company generally increases at 5% per year, which means 95% goes to just existing

9. In most creative industries, nearly everyone does nothing, and a few people do everything

10. You can't do much about your intelligence, but you can learn to work. Conscientious and industrious people, when they put their mind to something, they do it. They are the most successful people. (These are traits, there are aptitudes, but you can work on them). In 5 minutes, they do what most people do in one week, this is not an exaggeration, they are incredibly efficient. Discipline really matters - if you are wasting time, you need to learn how to get that under control. The best way to get that under control, is to pick something difficult that may take a couple of years, that way there is a big payoff and it is motivating - you want it, and you attend to it, and if you do that, you get discipline.

11. What matters if you study something, you study it hard. Studying it hard is what matters, more than what you study. As it builds discipline and gets results. It also makes your life more enjoyable, not less.

12. The best thing to do, is to learn to stop wasting time. It may require completely rewiring yourself to get that under control. If you want to be successful in your career, you really have to do that.

13. Everything you do as an academic will get rejected, and you will be told to quit, no matter how much work you put in, you will get those letters through your whole careers. Address the concerns, and keep going. Rejection rates in journals at 95-98%. Your paper may get rejected because it bad, and it may get rejected because it is too good and it scares people.

Why would you want to be a Professor?

1. When you are talking to people, do you tend to turn the conversation to ideas? If so, that is the openness trait. Then you are an intellectual. That is a good reason to be a Professor, as you like ideas!

2. If you talk about people or events or chit chat, probably an extrovert. If you talk about relationships, probably agreeable. Those are not the kind of temperament that is good for an intellectual pursuit. You have to like ideas!

3. The second thing is, do you like to teach? Teaching is brutal for those who don't like it. If you are terrified of students, do not become a professor.

4. A lecture is a performance. It takes a tremendous amount of energy. It is like spontaneous jazz for 90 minutes. You have to want that and like that.

5. When you get rejected, don't take it personally. They don’t hate you, they hate everybody! So you learn to tolerate that.

Should you also be a clinical psychologist?

1. That depends what you are inclined towards. For me (Jordan), life is better when I do many different things. I do clinics, I do consulting, I am a professor, I run a testing company that evaluates employees, and I have other jobs. I have 5-7 jobs. I learned how to do things flat-out all the time. For me that is better. I am wired for that.

2. You have to be insane to be a social worker. When you are a clinical psychologist, you are dealing with people who don't want their problems. When you are a social worker, you are dealing with people who don’t care about their problems.

There are three types of programs:

1. Ones that train you as a scientist and a clinician

2. Those that train you as a clinician ($40,000 a year)

3. And those that train you with clinical training and less on experimental work, they don't produce academics

Classes don't matter. The only thing that matters is publishing papers. That is what you should be doing. If you publish enough papers, you’ll get a job.

Graduate classes require an A to pass. Undergraduate classes it doesn't matter. No one cares for your undergraduate degrees.

You will need 5 papers published. Two where you are the first author. And two in top journals.

Do you want freedom? People float and drift with too much freedom - then you get hit on the head!

Most of Social Psychology is nonsense. So learn your psychometrics and statistics, and that will do you well.

About 90% of your classes will be a waste. Read the great clinicians instead. All systems are flawed. (referring that universities are included in that)

Most businesses fail. Only the good businesses generate 5% profit. Bad businesses suck time from what's important. Most systems don’t work, and a lot of them are murderous.

If you educate yourself, and you become useful. Then it doesn't matter your qualifications. As you have the testimonials that say you appear useful. Or you can go to an institution, pay a lot of money, where 90% of the courses won’t be useful.

Your job is to discriminate between things that are worthwhile and things that are not.

(ben: you get what you put in, and most people do not put in that much, or even care to)

You can't be a good clinician unless you are also a scientist. If you are a foolish clinician, you can cause a lot of pain and grief. Confused troubled people open up to you, it is your responsibility to help you. You must think critically. A good critical thinker gets rid of what is not necessary, and keeping what is necessary.

Listen to a person, and if you don't understand what they are saying, ask them. If you walk people through the process of clearly articulating their situation, the order enhances their brain. And you can do that even as a junior clinician, providing you are listening.

There are 2 things required to be motivated:

1. Imagine that you were charged with taking care of yourself. Now you are responsible to take care of yourself. Most people are ambivalent about taking care of yourself. You have to think what will be best for yourself - not what you want or what will make you happy - but what will be best for yourself.

2. You need to have a clear conception of what your life could be like, if it was really good. 3 or 5 years down the road, what would the best life be like? Think about friends, family, how you spend your time day to day. Think about it hard, clarify it, and then optimise around that.

3. What was my life be like if I let it really fall apart. If you meditate on it properly, it should really scare you. And you promise yourself, whatever happens, I will never do that.

4. You then weigh up your life, and your relationship to those two things, and you pick which ones you want. And if your life gets out of control, you make it worse, and that is hell - so as stay as far away from there as you can.

5. If you do this exercise regularly it will change your life. Sit on the edge of your bed when you wake up, and ask yourself as if you were asking your friend, asking someone you have positive feelings towards, ask yourself what you need to do to make the day progress in the best possible manner. Then ask yourself what you could do? Then ask yourself what you actually would do? Then you'll get an answer, the answer will drift up from the depth of your unconscious. You could do this and that, perhaps there’s things you’ve been avoiding, and you could do this little thing, without getting all resentful about it. Then tonight, my life could be 1/10th of 1% better, which is a lot over 1000 days, is 100% better.

6. Life is hard. Life is basically tragic in its essence. And if you don't carry that burden properly, it will make you resentful and cruel. And if you don’t want to be resentful and cruel, then you will pull yourself together, so you can be a force for good rather than evil. Which is a lot better. There is almost no limit to how much someone can suffer. — Which is why I like being a clinical psychologist, it keeps you in touch with the plight of human nature. You cannot do anything more valuable for possibly informing you on how to improve your own life.

7. You have to think about about who you are, where did you come from, how did it shape you. That is psychoanalysis. Then you have to think, well what do I want from this life? What sort of person do you want to be? We can be the most wretched of people, but a person who has their act together can be like a force of nature! You have the opportunity, you are smart, you are young. Hammer yourself together and see what you can do. Make your life way better. Unimaginably better. If that's what you want…

8. As you step through your life, you'll see there are certain things that call out to you, that grab your attention, involuntarily. That’s a very interesting thing, because people like to think that they are their own masters of their own destiny. There’s reasons this is not true. You are governed by forces you don’t understand, which is what psychoanalysts have deemed to be the unconscious. And unconscious forces are what makes you interested in things, and you can’t control that! If you are reading a dam boring paper, someone else may think that is the most interesting thing they’ve ever found, when you, you can’t even concentrate on it, you wander, you say you have to focus on it, there’s a test tomorrow, but your unconscious doesn’t care. But another paper you get, it sticks to you like glue, you are compelled by it, you remember it right away. Why is that? Why is one thing so interesting for you and another isn’t, and why can’t you control that? So if isn’t you who decide who you are interested in, well you gotta ask yourself, who controls that, if it is not you. By asking that, that’s when you become a clinical psychologist, because that’s a hell of a question.

9. So one of the things you can learn, is how to follow the things that can compel you. And you have to be careful when you are doing that, because you have to balance that with a certain degree of honesty, because if you are dishonest and deceitful then you corrupt the workings of your internal mechanisms, and the light will be shining from places you don't want it to shine from. So if you are going to pursue the things that compel you, which is a good thing to do, that’s a quest by the way, you also have to straighten yourself out ethically and you can take some bad times. And you will get ridiculously motivated if you do that because you'll end up living in a world where everything is so interesting to you all the time that you can hardly stand it, and that’s a good place to be.

If an experience will foster your independence and discipline, and broaden your experience, then no one with any sense will look at that but anything than positive.

The things that make people successful are:

1. Learning to work, and learning to socialise

2. Intelligence

3. Conscientiousness, that's discipline

4. Creativity, that is hard to develop if you don't already have it

5. A gradual social network, learning to socialise to develop a large social connection, that's unbelievably useful

6. Always better to do something than nothing, if you don't know what to do, then take a guess, and do it hard, and as you do it, you’ll learn what’s good about it and what isn’t, and it’ll bring you closer to what you want.

7. If you pay attention and you focus, you'll eventually figure out what you want.

If you want a career, you gotta figure out who you want to be.

It is a good idea to get a broad philosophical understanding, so you can figure out the difference between a great person and a trivial person. You should think about what makes a great person, and learn from culture's great thinkers, because they’ve thought about why that matters.

Master degrees are useless fundamentally. You can't practice with a masters degree anymore. For an academic career, a PhD is what you want.

If you are a experimental psychologist, generally you are heading to an academic career, although there are areas in business for that too. Juniors will start at a salary of $250,000. Businesses are now hiring psychologists rather than economists, because they are finding out psych models work whereas theirs don't.

On the clinical side, there is nothing more valuable than a clinical degree - as it will let you work anywhere, hospitals, clinics, business, etc.

If you want to set yourself up for this, learn not to waste time as you can control that. And think how you want your life to be and not to be, as that will increase you motivation.

You are not there to take on clients burdens. You are there to help them live properly. You can't do that if you are damaged by what you hear.

(Applause at the end - seems if you are a lecturer, and you are not getting applause, you have taught wrong.)

The reason you get screwed is because you put up with it. If you get ripped off, take responsibility, change your actions, and complain.
