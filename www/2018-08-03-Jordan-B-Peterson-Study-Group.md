**Jordan B Peterson Study Group**

Each week we discuss one of Jordan B Peterson lectures.

    * **Confidential Sessions**

        * **Saturday 3AM 03:00 UTC (Iceland/Reykjavik)**

            * Hosts: Sumit

            * Targets: Hawaii, Americas, India, Asia, Sydney, New Zealand

        * **Saturday 3PM 15:00 UTC (Iceland/Reykjavik)**

            * Hosts: Sumit

            * Targets: Americas, Europe, India

    * **Recorded Summary Sessions for ****[Podcast Distributio**n](https://jordanbpeterson.community/study-group-recordings/)

        * **Sunday 3PM 15:00 UTC  (Iceland/Reykjavik)**

            * Hosts: Sumit

            * Targets: Americas, Europe, India

    * **Agenda for each week is set via the ****[Meetings Categor**y](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/c/meetings)** on the ****[Jordan B Peterson Community Foru**m](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community)

    * **On the last week of every second month** instead of discussing a lecture, we will discuss a book from Jordan B Peterson's recommended texts as part of the [Jordan B Peterson Reading Group](https://jordanbpeterson.community/reading-group/).

* We have already discussed the [2017 Personality Lecture Series](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/c/personality-series), [2017 Maps of Meaning Lecture Series](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/c/maps-of-meaning), and the [The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/c/bible-series)

    * You can find the notes for our discussions for these series inside this document

    * We will do new sessions for already discussed series once current series have run their course

**To join the calls and to be notified of the session times, ****[you must subscribe to our calenda**r](https://jordanbpeterson.community/calendar/)**. **It handles the time zone magic for you. 

The join links are inside the calendar event descriptions. Click the join links to participate in the calls when they are happening. Screenshots: [Apple Calendar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tzIQtwq0Pm7g9NcLhTcllrHqN_cbqwQi), [Google Calendar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i8UHysgg4-EANr0k5LN1jh9vqkjrJXp-).

The calls are powered by [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com). Google Meet requires participants to either use the Google Meet [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hangouts-meet/id1013231476?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings) app, or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).Google Meet offers moderation abilities (muting background noise), better privacy protection (stronger privacy policy), and stability over the alternatives.Joining the calls may involve a prompt that asks you to install a Google Meet Browser Plugin. This is fine and takes about 5 minutes.

Duration of the Study Group calls have ranged between between 1 and 6 hours, with most between 1 and 3 hours. Participation in part is fine, and likely also valuable.

If you wish to share this document, you can do so via this link: [https://jordanbpeterson.community/study-group/](https://jordanbpeterson.community/study-group/) 

When participating we request participants mute their microphones when not speaking and if possible wear headphones. This will improve audio quality by optimising for bandwidth on active transmissions, as well as reducing opportunity for background noise and feedback. Feedback is when the output of your speakers is captured as input into your microphone, causing what was output to become input again, creating an echo for everyone else. Having the audio go through headphones prevents the opportunity for feedback, as your microphone will be unable to hear the output of your headphones.To mute and unmute, tap the screen or wiggle the mouse so the buttons appear, then toggle the microphone button. If it is red, then it is muted.If there is background noise, a moderator may mute your microphone for you. Simply unmute it whenever you wish to speak.When joining the call, we will finish the current conversation thread before doing an introduction. In the case we forget to do an introduction, feel free to participate anyway.

Our meetings are comprised of people from all walks of life, countries, identities, politics, temperaments, and so on. The meetings are often a refuge from our everyday echo chambers, where participants can discuss and experiment with dissenting views with people who can play devil's advocate, pushback, or expand. A place for participants to learn, grow, get feedback, and become less stupid. This liberty based dialogue also means we must respect the privacy of others at all costs. People can risk a lot in participating in these meetings, they may be in environments or societies where such free exchange is penalised.

The non-podcast calls should be considered and treated as private and confidential. The privacy of participants is of the highest importance. Participants, learnings, stories, discussions, etc should all be anonymised unless you have explicit permission from associated parties that you can do otherwise. As we cannot provide guarantees, you can chose to control your anonymity yourself, such as using a new Google account under an alias and using that to participate then anonymising yourself when you participate. If you are concerned about government surveillance, refer to [https://ssd.eff.org](https://ssd.eff.org) and [https://privacyforjournalists.org.au](https://privacyforjournalists.org.au).

While we focus primarily on the agenda items, anything [Jordan B Peterson](http://jordanbpeterson.com) is welcome.Our lecture notes can be found in the [Jordan B Peterson Lecture Notes.](https://jordanbpeterson.community/lecture-notes/)

Additional resources can be found at the [Jordan B Peterson Community Website](https://jordanbpeterson.community).For the respect of time, we will attempt to knock off the agenda items first, then move onto larger tangents and personal discussions afterwards.

If you need help with participation or have suggestions, ask away on our [Support Topic](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/study-group-reading-group-support/19).

Bhagavad gita

Accepting the cards that the universe gave you

When the world works against your attempts, do you press on or change your goals.

Finding a niche that only *You* can dominate.

Business growing, sharing secrets/goals or not.

Political debates.

Atheists that are actually Christian

Silicon valley

Youtube, pewdiepie  

2018-06-30

Cyclical time, the purpose of humans is to be the universal debuggers, to keep balance.

The world was created by people that recognized an anomaly and pursued a fix.

The matrix

The attitude of folks in Asia

* Environment

    * Overcrowded population

    * People are  treated horribly by their fellow citizens.

    * Social environment that promotes selfishness.

* Adaptation to current environment and lack of better ideals

* Lack of resistance to bad behaviour

* Management folks

    * No one's questions them.

    * Tyrannies people.

    * Lack of profit incentives to improve customer service

* Lack of inclination to improve people.

# 2018-06-16

* Trying to understand Sam Harris

    * Care vs Liberty may be Big 5 Agreeableness

    * Peterson says Sam doesn't take God seriously enough

        * Not as serious as Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, and Nietzsche, which are the other players Sam is contending with

* What is Sam's god and atheism?

    * God: Supernatural entity

    * Atheism, not believing in the supernatural

    * Claim: we don't need to inherit our morality from the stories we grew up with

* Problem with it

    * One can move away from the supernatural stories, but they can only replace their God

    * Religion -> Ideology -> Uberman

        * Leaving religion

            * Became more acceptable

            * But they swapped out supernatural god (God) for manmade god (Satan)

                * Nihilism  (cognitive dissonance) or Ideology (evil is good)

* God is an ideal, where all the rules/spirits converge

    * Satan is anything that doesn't lead to the ideal

    * Still need value judgement; Ought vs Is

    * Once you have judgement, you have the ideal

    * Whim/impulse is your god - Hedonism

    * Gods as men - Hitler, Stalin, Obama

    * Faceless gods - ideologies - feminism, marxism, communism

* Well what is the ideal?

    * Rand

        * Spirit

            * Reason - always check your suppositions

        * Idols

            * Prime movers vs second handers

        * God, what is worshipped

            * Man's creative spirit - the unique characteristic of men

        * Selfishness and Cynicism

            * Have to be cooperative to get what you want

            * No ability for abuse

                * If others live for you, you can tyrannise them

                * If you live for others, you can tyrannise yourself and others can

* Well what about meaning

    * Prepare yourself for the calling

        * Leverage your past with the strength of today to protect your vulnerable future self

            * Compounded interest - Law of increasing returns

    * Meaning often comes in hindsight

    * Entrepreneurship

        * Personal development as important career developer

        * Can't have a career if you can’t get out of bed

    * Meaning is localised, but who wouldn't benefit from pursuing creativity over stagnation???

Fri.

What's been working for Sumit and I.

Plans for these meetings. Having half structured, half stuff from our lives.

Sat.

Set up why to be anxious about death

fear of death, leaving things unfinished.

no longer existing

the afterlife as a comfort

afterlife is improbable

everything in this world is improbable

Cultures that do not have existential threat and angst.

Stoned ape hypothesis

loss/gain of fear of death from psychedelic experiences.

Dalai lama remembering past lives

Do trees fear death?

Why did humans gain self-awareness

We fear the loss of continuity

Giving up your spot for someone else, child or otherwise.

Death is not exactly loss of continuity, because I'd choose memory wipe over death.

The extension of Self as the antidote to death anxiety, via tribalism or

People lose meaning in their jobs because they do not think about their effect to everyone around them.

You're the elon musk of your own body

Donald hoffman, 

1st person 3rd person interaction

As we age we sometimes lose our desires for the things we haven't done.

# 2018-5-12

Religious bathroom

Religion is a coherent system of beliefs for how to act in the world

Religion as an acted out belief in a higher power

God as an axiom outside the universe

Religion as an intuitive sense that is later rationalized

Both theists and atheists are steadfast in their axioms,

Body language of them

You aren't taking it seriously: there are truths about the world that can’t be gotten via 

Religion is the culture surrounding the text

What is belief?

Difference between God-like AI and God? Subjectively the same

What do we lose from a metaphorical frame?

Who God is continues to change with time.

Belief, whether or not a proposition is true or false and whether we can act upon it.

Christians and muslims are not arguing about if god has a beard or not, they're arguing about the moral actions associated with their belief in God.

Belief as 'the ability to perform an action, and desire for that goal.'

People cannot act out the new life associated with that belief and so, they cannot believe it.

What is forgiveness? 'Forgetting' the sins of the other. Reclassifying the other so that they are not who they were. Redefining the model of the sinner to now be innocent.

Creating a space for people to now act within.

Nature abhors a vacuum

The required martyr of a dying system.

An individual requires a collectivism to go up against and adapt.

The ubermensche surpassing the limitations of the law.

Belief in the highest good, and love your neighbor

For athiests the highest good is well-being, but it isn't metaphysical, it’s metaphorical (Or truth)

What are the limitations of merely metaphorical language?

God is unprovable or disprovable within the frame of the universe.

People believe in both the man in the sky, rather than the highest good (personal/impersonal)

The loss of faith starts from the desire to stop following stupid rules, and the justification comes after.

Atheists follow the highest good, by losing religion.

Each side has the desire to grow their community as self-preservation for the newfound understanding of truth or well-being.

The motivations of Harris brought about by 9-11 and self-preservation

Suspicion of the motivations of the public people certain of their beliefs

Redefining go as the thing you want to bring about the most of into the universe. Well-being, consciousness.

What is well-being, the frame of understanding.changes based upon context

People don't want to call their fundamental values as God because that contains the emotional context.

Dillahunty's concept of metaphysics, within time.

Nothing metaphysical, but physical is expanded to include abstractions of behavior.

Meta as in Peterson's version of the meta-hero

Metaphysical as something external from the frame we reside in.

God as that which is cannot be defined down, and that which is necessary for the moment.

## Discussion on Morality

Saturday 3AM 03:00 UTC

*  God as a means to regulate human behaviour.

* Problem of a limited god of law or individual, 

* Fulfilling the responsibilities of previous action. And lineage

* Morality built off of gene spreading, firstly towards your genetic lineage, then self and spouse (being raisers of said lineage), then your shared gene-holders (siblings, family), then community, then society, then world.

* The value may change depending upon the threat of potential extinction within one layer that will affect the inner layer.

* Admiration of character based upon how successful the imitation of that character would relate to gene spreading into the future. Even if those admirable characters were actually accidents, their consequences teach us what will occur if we did the same.

* The evolution psychologically of the Christ figure within us.

* Conscience not merely within our head but within our spouses and other people we interact with.

* The discovery, and ability to discover, the best goods. Non-absolute, somewhat relative since admirability depend upon the system in place to allow that.

* Conacience, religion, and psychology.

* Purpose for morality/ethics

* Group selection.

* Unconscious intuitions of evolution.

* Morality based off of historical admirable characters of a society and their consequences.

* Swear words as indicators of moral tastebuds for the culture

* Moral responsibility (galileo/jesus)

# 2018-04-07

Saturday 3PM 15:00 UTC

* How to make progress towards your dreams ?

    * The Kaizen Method

        * The Method

            * Ask yourself what is the minimum step you could do that doesn't require any willpower on your side e.g. I will do one push up today.

                * Do it regularly and build a habit around it.

            * When you feel ready - increase that minimum step slightly e.g. do two push-ups instead of one in second week.

        * [Art of Manliness #341 The Kaizen Method - Get 1% Better Each Day](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/09/21/podcast-kaizen-self-improvement/)

        * [One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way by Robert Maurer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/266621.One_Small_Step_Can_Change_Your_Life?from_search=true)

* Interpreting your dreams

    * Take the collaborative approach.

        * Have someone ask you questions about it so that you can understand it better.

    * Meaningful dreams vs Entertainment dreams

    * Dream Recall: Write them down in the very moment - because your might not remember them later.

    * Experiment: Does your attire during sleep (sleeping in underwear vs in shorts) affect your dreams?

* Is it better to be innocent and have everyone think you are guilty or compromise, be guilty and have everyone think you are innocent.

* Is it better to oppose evil (and possible be killed) or comprosie to do more good in long term.

    * If you compromise you are killing the very thing that can stand up to evil?	i.e. if you compromise you die spiritually else you only die physically.

## [12 Rules for Life](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/jordan-b-peterson-12-rules-for-life/74/1)

Saturday 3PM 15:00 UTC

* Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back

    * Never be the person making a decision out of weakness

* Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for

    * About: Chris

    * Journalling

* Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you

    * @JOHN can you copy that quote in here

    * Rasmunich 

* Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday

    * Journalling

    * Lego towers for accomplished tasks to resemble the city you have built with your actions

        * Should you tear parts out when you did bad?

* Rule 5: Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them

* Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world

    * Which should be your main focus

    * Perfect order != perfect, without problems - it just means, ordered problems

        * In rule 12

            * Peterson and his wife would stop fighting in disorder, then have a break for a day and think what they did to contribute to the disorder

            * Dealing with Peterson's daughter, they set aside time each day, to keep battling everything, not just having that one thing take everything down

    * How could I be the problem to my family, and the world?

    * Don't preach what you can’t practice

        * Would be hypocritical for MLK to give marriage advice, but he didn't, he gave race treatment advice

        * Communist leaders expect the world to be more selfless than they are

            * If they were, they probably wouldn't be communists! 

    * 80-20 rule

    * Prager U - Fix Yourself

        * There are things in our control, and there are things that are not

            * It is vital to figure out what is in which camp, and acting accordingly

                * Like relationships, oedipal mothers, tyrannical governments - trying to control people as chess pieces, rather than units of their OWN agency

            * Create a list of things you can change (well), and things you can't change (well)

                * And optimise on delegation

                * Journaling as an accounting mechanism, of behaviour, emotions, and plans - and everyday thoughts and actions

                    * Evernote

                    * Day One

                    * Just Press Record

    * If you don't attend to your own issues, they will escalate, and you also risk projecting them as the world’s problems, rather than your own

        * Like people who don't fix their housing/finance issues, so then need government housing/welfare

        * Like transgender activists, who are bitter repulsive people, who demand others date them otherwise they are transphobes

        * If you don't sort yourself out, the world (your perspective of the world) is bound by own constraints

    * Complexes

        * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology))

        * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_complex)

        * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_syndrome)

            * Could the SJW - females who no longer feel significant from their boyfriends and children, so as they are people persons, they invent social problems to now feel significant

* Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)

    * The advice people offer, is what they used to get their results, and is also their justifications for their actions

        * So only take advice from people whose actions you wish to replicate

    * Assume yourself, and your peers, are doing the easiest action, rather than the most meaningful

    * If Rule 8 is your only meaning, then telling the nazi where the Jew is, you will be fine with, as you were truthful - is there a rule against this? As Rule 3 and Rule 2 could support this. In fact, none of the rules offer a counter to this - except perhaps Rule 9, in which the prisoner may know something you don't.

        * Willing to oppress another in the name of your ideology. Placing the ideology above the needs of the person you are oppressing.

* Rule 8: Tell the truth—or, at least, don't lie

    * Relying on karma, can perpetuate the growth of evil, eventually good needs to conflict with evil to prevent it

        * Both good and evil will grow in isolation, there needs to be conflict

        * Avenge through karma can also make your shadow grow larger

        * So be good against evil, when it is something you can control…?

        * Can also tie into Rule 9. That you may not know more than other person. You could be the evil.

        * Being sincere is the only way to eliminate the shadow, even if it hurts you now (rule 7)

    * What if nazis were going to kill the jew hiding in your closet?

        * Lying gives them justification for killing you

        * Honesty gives them a reason to question their aims, even if you die

* Rule 9: Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't

    * Even applies for you too

    * Modesty - the more I know, the more I don't know

* Rule 10: Be precise in your speech

* Rule 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding

* Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street - stop and smell the roses

    * About: Makhaila

    * About the journey not the destination

    * Work through things publicly (Rule 8) then others will help you work through them too!

        * Youtubers wrestle with things publicly, and that propels them to success

        * The youtubers that know the answers are blown out, as it turns out they never have the whole picture, and they refuse to grow!

* Coda - The Pen of Light

* Don't follow stupid rules [this rule came from interviews]

    * Why people have these polar opposite beliefs at the same time ?

        * E.g. Folks in high-tech sector who are also very religious.

    * Importance of marriage in life

        * Peterson bringing up marriage/family/children as source of meaning but lot of liberal media looks down on those values (and does disservice to young people by misleading them).

        * Most people derive meaning from their family/community and not all these exalted ideas of changing the world.

    * Rationality and daily life

        * You can analyze everything rationally and have to trust your instincts.

        * Why is Jacob wrestling against the God?

    * John's idea of using irrational beliefs to fight against your drives.

        * Using the same kind of irrational dragon to fight against temptations rather than having superego do it.

                    * What is people don't accept it since it's not voluntary ? What if one does want to take responsibility and grow up ?

* Meaning - Saturday 9AM 09:00 UTC

    * Women being able to judge men, rather than being oppressed by them, seems to be the animus that unlocked innovation and legacy - moving us from a cyclic (living at effect) worldview to a progress (living at cause) worldview. The 1:11:00 slide.

    * Weinstein issue is not rape, but prostitution. How should society deal with this?

    * Lower class is dominated by psychopaths and wolves. They are out for themselves, often out of circumstances. Wolves may sacrifice themselves so an external ideal may live - Sin Nombre movie - also in I will be a wolf so that my child can prosper. This offers hope for those of integrity. The wolves may protect them. Even if the wolves have evil.

    * Middle and upper class are places where people help each other.

    * How to deal with people who are not malevolent but misguided?

        * Help them see the light. Also help yourself in case they are right and you are wrong.

    * It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt - but it is through hurt you realise your actual boundaries, and through attitudes, how to overcome them and grow stronger

* Bible - Saturday 3AM 03:00 UTC

    * Putting yourself together and possibilities that open up with it. Importance of being a fool.

    * Bible is a revised document

    * Oughts and is are like the chicken and the egg - they evolve each other

    * Free will vs agency

        * Free will could be defined as predictions of one's actions

            * Darren Brown seems to then indicate there is no free will:[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=darren+brown](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=darren+brown)

    * Ben

        * Stefan on Charles Manson - the struggle to become better, but the attribution of failure to oneself, and alignment to evil which can be powerful (until you are corrected by society - Napoleon), or alignment to incompetence and vice which makes you weak (the Drunk).

            * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StK3oFcLWeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StK3oFcLWeU) 

            * Alignment in the two evil ways are not sustainable, as there is always an end date. Alignment in virtue is the only thing that is sustainable - as it creates civillity and cooperation of collaboration and competition, rather than just collaboration (feminine - no winners or losers - no breakthroughs) or competition (masculine - teams always have time bombs as only so long until mutiny or crumble).

            * To some extent, Raskolnikov is correct - there are two types of people. His entire story proves this. There are those who can kill without remorse, and those who cannot kill. He hoped to be the first, and his assessment "his only crime was to not succeed in his convictions" is correct, although “only crime” is debatable. He was not able to align with evil, and the dissonance (internal jihad) wrestles within him, to the cataclysm of his fate - society self-corrected, through the virtues of law, and self-healed, through the redemption of the individual - and to some extent, with the alignment of universal human truths - the desire for love/courtship/recognition/virtues.

            * The moral seems to be - if you are not a psychopath, do not tempt it, as it will take you under - and if you are, then it is only a matter of time until your wits end, and modern society catches or corrects you, instilling fear (but if you love the fear, and the chase, then that too can become your demise).

                * Two archetypes:

            * So need to have your life organized so that you can rest on last day.

        * Charity ?

    * Sumit:

        * Mutual sharing leads to trust

            * But someone has to take the first step.

            * Fear that people will use your faults against you.

        * Using your self-vulnerability as a force of good rather than using it to hurt people.

            * How to treat people ?

    * **JOHN:**

        * **Karl Marx**

            * Evolution works because there are thousands ultimately created for destruction.

            * Ideas also are very similar, they spread through beings, infecting us with an idea of truth, and we have responsibility to act out these truths that we think we know for sure, because if we do not speak them, or act upon them then there is no way to prove a higher truth of the two options.

            * Marx acted out his truth that he believed to be so, and suffered for it, and we gain a lot from him, unfortunately for him, what we gain is the knowledge that his 'truth' is sub-optimal, but there are still elements within it that need addressing, because if we do not address it then that leads to chaos.

            * He deserves a certain amount of respect, because had he instead done nothing, hid his truth inside himself then we in our current existence would not realize the negative aspects to communism.

        * **Job**

            * His suffering was 'deserved' in a funny sort of way because he gained a greater reward in the end, had he just gotten 7 times his original wealth he wouldn’t **deserve **it then

        * **Kierkegaard**

            * He also suffered, but wasn't rewarded in the end. The reward from his suffering is enjoyed by us, but he gained meaning by knowing that at some point, even after his death, that his work will be useful.

            * Funnily enough he lived out an aspect of Abraham's story because he worked hard towards something that he could’ve seen as futile, because everyone around him mocked him and his books meant nothing to the people he wrote for. But he lived in faith, like Abraham, and only from the future can we judge that what he did was indeed very worthwhile.

        * **Vulnerability**

            * If you cannot speak your truth even to your family, Your inability to trust them assumes that THEY are planning of taking your weaknesses or thoughts and will crucify you for them. If you cannot speak your truths to your family that means that you don't trust them not to be evil.

## [Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p0IuITRsgo)

What were your biggest takeaways from this week?

* How to make this world a better place when you are not sure about whether you have the right worldview or not ?

* Consciousness mind vs unconsciousness

    * When we encounter darkness rather than face it and admit your own potential for evil.

        * Don't address the darkness inside you and when you do see others do it - you disassociate yourself from them.

            * Turning people into something that we don't understand.

                * If you were in Nazi Germany you would never become a Nazi officer.

* Charity - if you do it well you are trying to make your job obsolete.

    * Terrible mother aspect where you don't let the child become independent because you derive pleasure/meaning from it being dependent on you.

    * [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731)

Talking Points:

* What other people think of you ?

    * What other people think about it does matter e.g. if you want to grow at your job so you don't just want to dismiss this idea.

    * Being detached about what other people think of you.

        * Sharing a dream with someone without the blueprint to achieve it.

            * Sometimes all you need is a dream and you will find a way.

                * Not everyone is able to do it, just die in the struggle.

        * My own struggles with the western culture.

        * Indian culture making it impossible to do the right thing.

* Saturday 3PM 15:00 UTC

    * What to do if I am not sure my beliefs are right or will make this world a better place ? What to do if I don't have the conviction ?

        * Acting out the beliefs allows them to evolve. Adapting our idea when they are faced with conflicts.

        * Take responsibility for your mistakes and expect them.

            * You will make mistakes along the way and there is no way around them. But these mistakes allows you to evolve.

            * You are assuming bad ideas don't have any value. Maybe some people will find them useful.

            * What kind of personality you are ?

        * Fear of judgement, should you be sure before putting out ideas that go against the norm ?

        * Fear of convincing people of ideas that are utterly wrong. If I don't feel my ideas are correct how do I advocate for them ?

            * Find out the most elemental ideas and check if your ideas conflict with them.

        * Two ways of looking at the world

            * The Zealot - Zealot is a true believer in the idea. Advocates it. Lives it and willing to fight for it and put himself/herself in harm's way.

            * The Explorer - The explorer admits he doesn't know everything and shares/tests news ideas. He is more like a scientist.

        * Start something and let it evolve.

    * **The idea that the dragon is protecting you from the Gold.** The fact that you have to confront the dragon means you will need to develop required courage, discipline, humility and know how. Those skills will enable you to make proper use of Gold or treasure, else you might fall prey to being robbed, use it for your addition, mismange it.

            * So the very obstacles you face are not necessarily your enemies. They are an invitation to grow and become better. If you are graduated to the next level using some cheat-code you will not be able to handle the next level of problems. So you may want to think about all the problems you ran away from - while doing that you also threw out chances of self-growth out the window.  

    * Self-hypnosis - When you are mentally/physically tired, lie down in bed in sleeping posture. Start thinking about ideas you want to gain insight on. Eventually you will move into this half-wake/half-sleep state that might allow you to gain some insights. (Make sure you do it at a time that is different from your regular bedtime).

        * Ties in with the idea of lucid dreaming.

    * Advice on getting out of bed.

        * First try to wiggle all your toes.

        * Try to develop movement in all your hand fingers. By lifting first finger and putting it down. Then moving on to the next finger.

    * Idea that how sometimes verbalising a problem makes it more real.

        * If you call out a problem it becomes more prominent. If you try to focus on not watching porn you will end up watching it more enough.

            * It's better to feel your time with positive things instead.

            * Find out the trigger that leads to bad behaviour and work on that trigger instead

            * We humans project our humanity on interpretation of the world.

                * If Dolphins were coming up with this stuff they will probably think of shark instead of a dragon.

                * So the idea of God created by humans only apply to humans only ?

    * I'll try to refine those ideas.

        * Does our limitation of our understanding of consciousness matter in regards to actuality of existence?

        * Since Science's frame of reference of the world is limited by the information we have currently…. Not sure how to extract these fuller, it’s still inarticulate

        * Humans are more than just their own consciousness, because our body works within us without our own control over it. Just as an anthill is more than any factual account of scientific details, number of ants, the current lives of the ants, and the size of the hill. All of these details can change while still being part of the same original anthill. The anthill, in it's own simplicity is a collection of subsystems, all subject to change, almost like an unconscious consciousness. Humans are similar, as we are a collection of subsystems. Is our conscious idea of our own collection of subsystems technically inaccurate, as must of our body is not under the control of our conscious mind?

        * Since Humans are more complex than the ants and the anthill, so also is our universe we reside inside of more complex via our own minds. Not to say that our notions of a higher goal to work towards (God) is a projection as we do exist in the universe and we are technically rewarded from our sacrifices we make. Maybe our conscious idea of consciousness is mistaken to apply to larger, more complex subsystems, where our own minds only make up small portions of it

        * I think using an anthill for example is not optimal. I would instead use the microbiology within our own stomach with its own subsystems as a better example, as it can be applied upwards.

        * It still needs more work.

    * Sumit: **The dragon is protecting you from acquiring the gold before you're ready.**

What were your biggest takeaways from this week?

* Sumit

    * Maps of Meaning #1

        * Peterson has taken a huge burden, and fortunately come out to the other side with rewards

            * The hero's journey

            * Picking the biggest and most important load you can

        * Silent leaders

            * Shapiro may be the spokesperson but the audience are those in the frontlines

            * Gladiators

        * Gravestone to Milestone

        * A small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world, indeed it is the only thing that ever has - Albert Camus?

        * Read books instead of doing other things by default

        * Small acts of kindness really make the world a better place

        * Tal Ben-Shahar

            * [https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/harvard-positive-psychology-course-1504/#harvard-positive-psychology](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/harvard-positive-psychology-course-1504/#harvard-positive-psychology)

        * Beware your own actions, as you might be entertaining angels unaware

        * Annoyance - Meditation retreat

        * Find the truth and then ignore it

        * Observe yourself, and be present, and then you can steer yourself in a positive way

            * Others want to overturn negative systems, and yet they cannot steer themselves

            * Sometimes the correct response is to be outraged, but nearly all of the time it is not

                * Similar to how Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is the treatment for Anxiety disorders

            * This is a treatment to being offended too

        * You cannot change your behaviour just by thinking, but you can change your thinking by doing things

        * Cleaning rooms - if you actually act, change happens - you can't clean your room by thinking

            * You can also do this for your life

            * The (metaphorical) flood is coming, so be prepared for it

        * Those at the top of the pareto can grow by giving away their things and growing in different areas

            * Which can also assist the area they have won, as they can bring new things into it (new spoils from other battles)

                * Nietzsche's uberman - doesn't just stay high on the bridge, but goes under the bridge for a new journey where others are higher than them

        * Coping - adaptive and maladaptive

            * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)#Types_of_coping_strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)#Types_of_coping_strategies) 

        * In anguish, everyone prays to him, in joys there's none, for everyone who prays in happiness, how can sorrow come

        * Adaptation - Ants change their roles (do they change their biology too?) based on the social needs

* Ben

    * Milo event

        * 1984 hate

        * Psychopathic spectrum

    * Bible lecture

        * Comparison with Napoleon Hill's teachings

            * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill) 

            * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/index.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/index.htm) 

        * Individuals and societies being operated by a subconscious dream - Dawkins' meme - that guides and influences us and society, through generations, that we articulate in art - our/society’s/nature’s actions/procedures are observed by the dreamer, to influence dreams/imagination, to influence articulation/language - as the operation of game, has more detail than can be understood, so is absorbed into the dream, wrestled with, with changes acted upon, with portions articulated

        * When our knowledge becomes out of sync with our subconscious dreamlike state, a sickness of spirit occurs, leads to nihilism or ideological possession (a crippled religion)

            * Cognitive Dissonance

                * Should self - conformance with society

                * Ideal self - conformance with the dream

                * Actual self - conformance with the individual

        * Architecture of God Belief

            * Think of the universe as box, with you inside it, and laws and rules that govern the operations within the box

            * The ways in which the environment influences you that are beyond your control - are spirits (or lowercase gods)

            * The rule maker that setup the environment - is the God, the god of the gods

            * Alignment with God/gods - the ways the environment work - produces the best results

            * Science helps us understand the environment and rules, reduces the placeholder that God covers

                * With each reduction of that placeholder into human power, we transmute an external god that influenced us beyond our control, into an internal god that we control

            * Abuse - I am God - there will be something unforeseen to take you down

            * Abuse - God is on my side - you could always be wrong

            * Sam Harris - Ayn Rand - Secular Self Interest

            * Liberal vs Conservative - Self Interest and Societal Interest

* John

    * Biblical meeting 1

        * Islam is run by rights and laws, not by choice or change.

            * Amish and Mennonites adopting electricity

                * The Mennonites - Living in a Perfect World Documentary

                    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZIPk-1ETc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZIPk-1ETc4)

        * They suppress art (dreams) which keeps from examining their existence, and from having an ideal to move towards,

    * Biblical meeting 2

        * The fear of god is the beginning of wisdom - The acceptance of the unknown, the constantly asked question of 'Is this God? Is there God?' leads us to further coming closer to infinity (God)

* Natha

    * Do you think that religious people generally agree with Peterson's ideas about the role of religion (that it doesn’t describe objective reality)?

## [Bible #1](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/bible-lecture-1/36/1)

* Saturday 3AM 03:00 UTC

    * Dream are memes that exist in many layers of abstraction in people, animals, and society

    * Crossover with Napoleon Hill's teachings

    * What parts of my morals are mine versus my culture

    * Science has left a void that Jung is filling

        * Music

        * Art

        * Youtube

        * Social life

        * Science can explain why we do these things - it feels good - but now why we have that programming in the first place

    * Creative people with structure perform better than if they were left to their own devices

    * Bible is a book which interpretation changes with the reader, and the reader over time

    * Seems there is more understanding in embodied action, than in ever longing intellectual understanding

    * Until you make the unconscious conscious, then it will direct your life and you will make it fate

## [Meaning #1](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-1/22/1)

* Saturday 9AM 09:00 UTC

    * Sumit

        * Started out with discussing Why was JBP so obsessed with nuclear war when other people were going about their life just fine ?

            * Tyler pointed out that it was probably due to his Christian upbringing and then having to face the seemingly opposite reality of folks trying to destroy the whole world.

        * Brian asked that (paraphrasing) Is it worth it to follow the path of the knight ? (Most people will get eaten by the dragon why not just maximize pleasure in life ?)

            * Newton was able to stand on the shoulder of the giants but even the giants had to rely upon countless folks to get where they were.

            * Tyler: A stone in the middle of a Pyramid might question its own worth since it's not at the top but it is contributing to the structural integrity of the pyramid.

            * Yes most of the knights might die but maybe a lot of them will be able to wound the dragon enough and that will enable the hero to defeat him for sure.

        * Pareto Distribution: What's the correct strategy to help/deal with folks at the bottom since they will resort to crime ?

            * Why do you want to help them in the first place ?

                * Needs to be done in public interest.

                * It's tricky to help them without taking properly/money from those at the top ?

                * Idea from Bible that rich will take place of the poor and vice versa in that case the hierarchy becomes kind of a circle.

                    * It's not very clear as to how to achieve this.

        * IQ Issue: If you have a low IQ and since Peterson keeps saying it's fixed what does that mean for people who still want to progress ?

            * Tyler and me are very interested in this, needs a detail discussion at some point.

    * Brian

        * Hume's "Is and Ought"

        * The idea that there is more than one kind of truth. Pragmatic truth vs scientific truth. Peterson's disagreement with Sam Harris 

* Saturday 9PM 21:00 UTC

    * No one else showed up

## [Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYMvD4ttIow)

* Seems oppression is about lack of choice, in which case

    * Capitalism offers everyone choice, but more to the rich/rewarded

    * Socialism offers the poor more choice than the rich

    * Communism offers the weak less power than the strong

* Dignity - Deus Ex Machina

* Religion - oppression is choice?

    * Are constraints of awareness oppressive?

        * Women in Amish/Islam - they have constraints, but most worship those constraints

    * Ties in with the "Interview a Plant" from “Poppy”

* 1984 / Brave New World - is that future choice?

* Main takeaways:

    * (John)  Is the best way to help those lower than you, to give them the choice and ability to move upwards?Socialists are not putting in all this effort to help the poor out of love, but because of how much they hate the rich. They, like the Nazis, also find the poor disgusting

* Saturday 3AM 03:00 UTC

    * Meeting failed

* Saturday 3PM 15:00 UTC

    * Place your upcoming and as you go, talking point ideas, here

    * Socialism isn't quite only about "hating the rich"? Peterson (over)simplifying Orwell?

        * What is good for the individual *as well as *good for the whole society?

        * Is it ever just to sacrifice the individual for the "*greater good"?*

    * Fascism as tyranny of resentful and fearful bourgeoisie, versus Communism as tyranny of resentful and fearful proletariat.

    * Orwell's argument against Utopianism: even if machines eliminated all work, people would still look for work to do. This is Dostoyevsky’s and also JBP’s view on Utopia: 

        * "The truth is that many of the qualities we admire in human beings can only function in opposition to some kind of disaster…" (85)

        * Every individual is, at different time, oppressor *and *oppressed. Ideology is the oversimplification of this reality.

    * Are constraints of awareness oppressive?

        * Women in Amish/Islam - they have constraints, but most worship those constraints

    * **Seems oppression is about lack of choice, in which case**

        * **Capitalism offers everyone choice, but more to the rich/rewarded**

        * **Socialism offers the poor more choice than the rich**

        * **Communism offers the weak less power than the strong**

    * **Dignity**

    * John: not all workers imagine the utopia. They just want higher wages, etc.

        * Michael: Just as SJW's claim to wage revolution on behalf of all LGBT people, black people, women, etc., bourgeoisie communists falsely claim to represent the universal wish of all working class people. In reality it is not that simple.

    * "The lower classes smell” – **The real reason that higher classes don't view lower classes as their equals** (says Orwell).

        * Disgust sensitivity.

        * Do you agree that the reason upper- or middle-class people don't act like working-class people is that they find them disgusting?

        * Why do we make people we don't like disgusting? Or is it people we want to avoid?

        * Do people still have this idea about working-class people? 

        * 10 minute read: Danger of solipsism: David Foster Wallace "This is water" [http://metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf](http://metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf)

            * DFW spent his entire career critiquing postmodern irony. Great writer for understanding postmodernism. 

    * Tyler: Public intellectuals like Milo consider themselves parental figures.

    * Postmodernism as the overly critical destructive extreme of reasonable critique of western tradition. Arthur Douglass 

    * Benjamin: debating distracts from real action to solve real problems. Barbara: how often does debate actually change anyone's mind?

    * JBP's anti-postmodernism web application for detecting postmodern course descriptions. Shutting down women’s studies departments? Doesn’t that contradict free speech? Doesn’t it infantilize students by assuming they aren’t capable of responding critically to a postmodern course?

    * Privileged classes replace God as the oppressor.

    * Tyler's argument against universal suffrage: universal enfranchisement divides the family unit. Definitely true.

        * Michael says: but can husbands be trusted to vote on behalf of their household, and not just themselves? Can individuals be humble enough to reduce their vote according to their knowledge, intelligence, etc.? 

    * Tyler: old testament is what *is. *New testament is what *could be.*

    * **Loving thy enemy. True strength is turning the cheek. Is this the proper male response to female physical abuse? Since as JBP says: "if you win you're a tyrant. If you lose you’re just bloody pathetic". Sane women need to talk sense in the radical feminists? Men can’t do it?**

    * **Failure as a virtue**

## [Personality #20 (conscientiousness)](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-20/67/1)

### Talking points

* Brian

    * Jordan makes distinction between anxiety and disgust, e.g., with OCD (being more about disgust than anxiety). In this lecture, he underscores role of disgust in rejection of outgroup members (conservatism and with Nazi Germany) as the social immune system. Previously Jordan emphasized the fear of the unknown/novelty, as part of an anxiety system (Jeffrey Gray's work). I wonder whether and how the disgust and anxiety perspectives of reaction to the stranger (outgroup member) would be reconciled.

    * Another question about anxiety/disgust. Jordan discusses National Socialism as motivated by disgust and being more embodied (bottom up) than communism, which he describes as being more about ideas. Given that Nazism is more about emotion, he states it might be less susceptible to critique via idea. I find these points very interesting. But then wondered about his (and others) ideas that all ideologies are about anxiety management. If so, wouldn't communism be equally influenced by negative emotion (in this case anxiety)? And would it thus also be difficult to refute via ideas because of this? If so, are there still meaningful differences between these 2 types of ideologies in relation to negative affect (disgust or anxiety)?

### Discussion notes

* Saturday 03:00 (3am) London Time

    * Older you get, more conservative you get - perhaps immune system based

    * Japan wear face masks - are they more conservative?

    * Role of aeroplanes, factory farming, pesticides

    * What happens when superbug strikes

    * Did superbugs control liberal population?

    * Perhaps liberal population has been historically controlled by environmental and social disasters, as well as controlled by governments/religions

    * bottom of dominance hierarchy with outside world - introversion and neuroticism would also play a role

* Did emotions arise solely to orient ourselves around goals, or is that a side effect?

    * Seems goals only

* Addiction

    * Role of serotonin

    * Role of dopamine

    * Role of porn and novelty

* Feminisation of workforce

    * Agreeableness is the tendency to agree with the top of the dominance hierarchy

        * When women got the right to vote then the right to work, they could now agree with themselves collectively

        * Agreeableness is also the outsourcing of your ideas to a collective, where you only hold fragments of yourself

            * An idea that is held by others that they can only argue portions of it, is more true to them, than an idea that an individual can argue comprehensively

    * Men historically avoid competing with women

        * Violence removes a uterus

        * And an unhappy wife/women is a failure of the man to please them

            * But as the husband is now the state, men cannot please the women, so are failures in the women's eyes, as they can demand more from the state than the man

    * Possible solutions

        * More women who disagree need to vocalise it, not to convince others (that is impossible), but to show that there are dissenters and they must be accommodated

        * Men need to start treating people based on the gender they act, rather than the gender of their sex - if women want to act like men, they should be treated as men

## [Brave New World](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/aldous-huxley-brave-new-world/71/1)

### Discussion notes

* Ben's review [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2082992027](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2082992027)

    * When you read 1984, it is hard to find any justification for IngSoc policies. A brave new world however takes the ideals of socialism and applies that with technological innovation, such that no one needs to work or be dissatisfied, but one chooses to be to the extent it enables their own happiness. It allows a society to operate within the ideal boundaries for individual choices and happiness. With threats outside of that to be grandiose romantic fantasy. It is hard for me, as one who believes in the role of technology as an equalising factor, and one who also values choice, to find any sympathy for John, that are beyond my own romantic ideals of a more primitive way of being - ideals that I suspect do not hold well to rationalisation. Looking forward to discussing this book in the Jordan B Peterson Study Group.

* However, in Brave New World, once the society is accomplished, technology and science ceases to innovate

    * Main goals of the Brave New World utopia is stability, and happiness

        * If your goal is stability, you cannot really progress, you can't get the highs and lows of progress and art

        * Brave New World turns people into docile cows

    * Seems a goal of brave new world is to return people to before they ate from the from the tree of knowledge. Is that a good idea or a bad idea?

        * You will have less knowledge, less understanding

* Can you quantify happiness? Is happiness a formula? Is happiness personal (is the way it is accomplish differently from person to person)?

* Is truth what is pragmatic? As what Brave New World was doing was very pragmatic

* Were the people satiated in Brave New World? It seems not, John's girlfriend longed for more

* Would you rather live a life where you felt nothing, over a life where you felt joy but also misery?

    * After antidepressants, some people tire of feeling nothing, and start wanting to feel things

        * Why?

            * Because they want to feel again?

            * Because they want their feelings to be true?

                * Then the question becomes - what is truer about that?

    * Would people in concentration camps, in situations of extreme misery, if they had a drug where they could feel nothing, would they take it?

        * John did want to feel, and he did end up killing himself - is that really a better outcome than not feeling anything?

        * John's girlfriend did desired satiation, but that ended up with her being whipped

* Could John have chosen different meaning? 

    * Neither world - the savage world - nor the brave new world - were compatible with John's meaning

    * Balance between

        * Being too open where the outside state defines you

        * Being too closed where you prevent yourself from adaptation

    * He was an outsider in both worlds

    * The flaw of his outcome, was him not using his outside categorisation, to change the society in a beneficial way

        * However, could he have? Did the society even want to change? The conversations with the Controller indicated he had already thought of everything John had thought of, and provided counter arguments for them.

            * Crossover with the conversations with The Architect in the Matrix

            * For the holocaust victims, would they have preferred to be lobotomised to not feel pain?

                * If Sisyphus is drugged to feel that pushing the boulder is the best thing ever, is that okay?

                    * Susan Wolf - Meaning in Life and Why It Matters

                        * [https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/w/Wolf_07.pdf](https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/w/Wolf_07.pdf) 

                    * Are such drugged feelings delusional? Or are they reality?

                        * delusion | dɪˈluːʒ(ə)n | noun an idiosyncratic belief or impression maintained despite being contradicted by reality or rational argument, typically as a symptom of mental disorder: the delusion of being watched. • [mass noun] the action of deluding or the state of being deluded: what a capacity television has for delusion.

        * If you are faced with options you do not agree with, then it becomes your responsibility to update your premises or to change those options

            * Gulag Archipelago - he could not change the circumstance, but he could change the meaning of the circumstance by writing the book and influencing the collapse of the soviet union

            * When faced with the option of limited misery in reality or unlimited happiness in virtual reality, we must also think about changing those options

                * You have a choice of how you want to respond to the miserable

* Is the end, where everyone is happy yet docile, is that okay?

    * They are left no choice to be anything else, as the system does not support it

    * Is happiness overrated? Can happiness be quantified? Should we pursue meaning over happiness? Would we rather have truth or happiness? Is truth delusional?

    * Docile like an animal, as it returns people to the state before they ate from the tree of knowledge

        * How is this necessarily bad?

        * Are there circumstances where this is better?

* More was discussed, it was an extremely productive 6 hour session

* Is Frankl an existentialist?

    * Lecture 11

        * 48:26 - slide - existentialism is not a school of thought nor reducible to any set of tenets. The three writers who appear invariably on every list of existentialists - Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre - are not in agreement on essentials. Such alleged precursors as Pascal and Kierkegaard differed from all three men by being dedicated Christians; and Pascal was a Catholic of sorts, while Kierkegaard was a Protestant's Protestant. If, as is often done, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky are included in the fold, we must make room for an impassioned anti-Christian and even more fanatical Greek-Orthodox Russian imperialist. By the time we consider adding Rilke, Kafka, Ortega, and Camus, it becomes plain that one essential feature shared by all these men is their perfervid individualism. The refusal to belong to any school of thought, the repudiation of the adequacy of any body of beliefs whatever, and especially of systems, and a marked dissatisfaction with traditional philosophy as superficial, academic, and remote from life - that is the heart of existentialism. - that is another element of individualism, the locale of action is in the individual, you are fated in some sense to suffer and to be an individual, so the right level of analysis is at the individual, which is a primary tenant of individual psychotherapy

    * You need to be able to find meaning in anything that you do

        * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy) 

            * Finding meaning, in yourself, or other people, or in a goal

            * The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:

                * Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.

                * Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.

                * We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

    * Sacrifice for one's values

        * A set of values that one can achieve, and work towards, and sacrifice themselves to achieve that

            * When the person's wife has died, he saved his wife who he loved

    * Is using hypotheticals ethical or unethical? Are they white lies?

        * Metaphysically true versus objectively true

            * Everything happens for a reason?

                * Objectively unprovable, but useful

        * East tries and changes their internal world to match their external world.

        * When this mismatch occurs, they can either:

            * Blame the external world aka society - easiest

            * Blame themselves - you ability to match society

            * Blame their ideals - the worst, as who wants to admit their ideals are wrong, the things that you've set out and orientated yourself around for decades, who wants to blame that

            * Seems tied to Cognitive Dissonance, how when a mismatch of the 3 selves occur, one exists in angst/contradiction/disintegration until they drag one or both to match all 3 again

                * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) 

                * Should Self

                * Actual Self

                * Ideal Self

        * Entitlement to rights - please expect the ideals to already be met by society, that everything should already be perfect - and when that is not true, they will get very offended

        * Political decisions - people really hate to admit that they are wrong or to face the unknown, so they candour out irrational expansive ideas about what is going on - overarching explanations for everything, patriarchy, god, marxism, etc

            * This could be caused by people need to have a theory, in order to act. If you have different ideas that are incompatible, then you cannot formulate a plan of how to act.

            * Low-resolution thinking vs high-resolution thinking. The world is so complex, we can never understand all of it at high-resolution thinking. So a lot of the times, we defer to these stark low-resolution explanations of the world, just so we can move forward, as sometimes it is better to act wrongly than to not act at all. You have to be strategic with the balance on this.

            * It is rare to be critical of your own beliefs, as for many, an attack of their beliefs, is a personal attack, that hurts. You need reasons to be motivated to be critical of your own beliefs, with that, it no longer hurts.

            * People also tend towards confirmation bias, as correlation biases. Pro-abortion also correlates highly with global warming.

            * People also don't know what they want, or what is good for them, what they need. People have a tendency towards hedonism, even it works against them. Delayed gratification is hard.

            * Philosophy is hard, as it is thankless. As a creator and a westerner, you want to manipulate the external world and get benefit from the external world. Programming takes months before you may get a result. Design is immediate. Philosophy seems is one of these delayed things. How do we justify the investment in it, when it is hard to see the results?

                * It seems what people want to do, is when they are trapped on a desert island, is to just trust their intuitions and build a raft, and get out of there. And when they get out to the ocean, that raft can sink, and they never systematically tested their intuitions, they just trusted their intuitions will guide them to safety.

                * Then you have the scientist, who tests their raft strenuously, over all sorts of conditions, over what could be years, which sucks as who wants to be stuck on a desert island for that long, but when they actually go out into the ocean, they survive.

                * It is only a matter of time, for those who built their rafts entirely on intuition, before the raft crumbles and they nearly down, or sometimes they do drown.

        * When your value system crumbles, you are only left with negative emotion, so one can prefer totalitarian certainty over nihilistic chaos.

            * Whereas a philosopher as well as the survivalists, will admit, that there are few things they do know, which could still be wrong, and there is also a lot that they don't know

                * *Jainism Syādvāda*

                    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da)

                    * There are things that I know which are true

                    * There are things that I know which are not true

                    * There are things that I do not know, which are true

                    * There are things that I do not know, which are not true

                    * There are things that I know I do not know

                    * There are things that I do not know that I do not know

                    * There are things that I know that I know

                    * There are things that I do not know that I know

                * Survivalists must know the limits and boundaries of their knowledge, as for them, it is life or death

                    * Which is interesting, as city people generally despise the redneck survivalist

                    * For city people, they know their comforts, and when they step out of their comforts, their world ends and they flip out

        * Postulation; City life is hard to be in touch with their human condition, they are dependent on artificial systems that protect them, and when they fall down they don't know what to do

            * Socrates - the more distant one is from the results of their work, then the harder it is for them to draw motivation from their work

            * Stereotypes of Rednecks/Old people - they get very scared of technology, perhaps because it is unnatural for them

            * Socrates - all learning is remembering forgotten knowledge

                * Intuition could be considered a forgotten knowledge

                    * Intuition is based on systems ingrained in us, that have been tested against the time of life's beginning

                    * **Where our environment acts against our intuitions, it can stress us**

                * Knowledge was a lot different back in Socrates times. At that time, if you could reason something, it was true. It wasn't until Descartes started realising the limits of his reason with his early developments of the scientific method, and then Kant wrote his critiques of reason, that society started seeing there was knowledge outside of reason, and the emergence of objectivity occurred.

                * Intuitions may also be maladapted for modern living, as they may also be optimised for tribal living.

                    * Lets have sex at every opportunity and have the tribe raise the children, until foreigners come to our land and STIs emerge, then we must invest the intellectual concepts of decency, modesty, and dignity to prevent the spread of STIs, none of which are intuition based

                        * There are also genetic proclivities for monogamy and promiscuity 

                    * It is also intuitive to blame the 1% as it is easy to have the intuition of injustice and unfairness, with systems like capitalism requiring a lot more high-resolution thinking to see the fairness in the system

                * These shortcomings of intuition is why we invented the scientific method

        * People are also not capable of often knowing what they really believe. They are often walking contradictions of disintegrated concepts. You can also convince people through repetition of anything.

            * **Are your beliefs really your beliefs, or are they merely things you have become accustomed to?**

    * You teach them to become brave. They have the courage to try new things. They become bored of their comfort zone and desire expansion against the cage of their *own* boundaries.

        * **Question: As the person becomes more brave, they can stand up to tyranny against them in a relationship. Would this also apply to their relationship with the state, being less able to be tyrannised by the state? And if the citizens of a society are made brave, are they less able to be tyrannised by the state?**

            * What is bravery?

                * Not about not being afraid, about being afraid, and still acting despite your fear.

                * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage)

                    * **Courage** (also called **bravery** or **valour**) is the choice and willingness to confront [agony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering), [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain), [danger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk), [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty), or [intimidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation). **Physical courage** is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while **moral courage** is the ability to [act rightly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) in the face of popular opposition, [shame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame), [scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal), discouragement, or personal loss.

                    * The [classical virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues) of **fortitude** (*andreia, fortitudo*) is also translated "courage", but includes the aspects of [perseverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance) and [patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravery#cite_note-Rickaby-1)

            * If you know what to do in a situation, then people will perceive you as brave. Even if you yourself a terrified.

                * This then ties into what the rat does - it keeps exploring its fear until it becomes bored with it.

                * **Are leaders then people who either know what to do, or have an intuition about what to be done? **And as such those who don't, trust them, and perceive them to be brave.

            * People with chronic pain do not feel less pain. This goes against the more pain you feel, the tougher you will become.

                * This is also a counter argument to the teasing the snail example, when applying that to humans for pain.

            * As you experience something, your competency with it increases. And as you become competent in one area, it spills into helping you to become competent in more areas.

            * Moral courage, is interesting. A lot of men would have bravely towards pain and uncertainty - teenage boys are a testament to this, in the displays of their bravery through dangerous means to be attractive to teenage girls, as those who are brave can do a better job of protection. But many of these people, perhaps do not have moral courage, despite having courage in other areas. Gad Saad talked about moral courage, where for him, he gets outraged at untruths, it physically hurts him and antagonises him, so he must do something to address it.

                * A lot of those from the regressive left appear to have moral courage. Although perhaps they have moral fervor, rather than moral courage, as often when their perspectives are countered, they panic and retreat.

                    * They don't risk anything, as their social environment agrees with them.

                    * Moral courage would also be the courage to question your own morality to make it stronger.

                        * Moral fervor just means you get outraged easily.

                    * One can virtue signal their outrage and moral fervor. But as soon as they themselves are confronted by authority, they scurry away. As soon as their words have accountability, they run.

* Existentialism

    * Definition:

        * Often explained in society as the matrix example; your perception of the world exists in your mind, so if you change your mind, you change your reality.

        * In this lecture it seems explained with similarity to postmodernism, although postmodernism seems to throw the baby out with the bath water, whereas this acknowledges no one body of knowledge can be perfect, however we can still find utility in each of them, and shouldn't hold sacred reverence in any. And as such, because we can’t be sure of how we interpret the external world, at least at the very best we target our own actions and our agency, to the extent that it can affect the external world.

            * Seems an answer to Nietzsche's "god is dead"

    * Individual agency and responsibility seems to be lacking in American society now

        * Sexual education is now the responsibility of the school, rather than the parents (also highly applicable in Sweden)

            * Justification is as both parents are now working, they do not have time to teach their kids such things (perhaps they both shouldn't be working if they are having children - however there are economic reasons for it) so someone "has" to

                * Do they really have to? It is not that hard to figure out sex, as sex is intuitive for the most part, or a rewarding learning experience with your partner.

                    * Hard to figure out STI and pregnancy prevention though.

            * It is good showcase of the problems of legitimation

                * Book recommendation: Ben Shapiro - Porn Generation

                * As soon as something becomes legitimised, it now delegates away from individual responsibility. As soon as it is taught in the schools, it no longer becomes the parent's responsibility - even though school teaching is last resort, because IT IS the parent's responsibility - they just aren't fulfilling their end of it.

                    * Because the school system now teaches it, we don't need to anymore

                * Morality is communicated to the children from the political leans of the teacher - and with sexual education in schools, and school teaches being overwhelmingly left leaning, left leaning sexual morality is also injected into the children

                * The legitimisation of sex education, also legitimises more and more deviant things as times go by, that were not in the original subscription of STI and pregnancy prevention - now in Victoria, Australia can also be teaching of masturbation, dildos, vibrators, etc

            * Places without sex education in schools, also have higher teenage pregnancy rates

                * What is the extent of this study? As it is an observation, so we need to draw the right conclusions.

                    * What is the relationship status of them? Do they keep the baby? Do they wedlock?

                    * Are they as promiscuous outside of relationships, in relationships, and in marriage? It seems there will be more promiscuity in the schools that do teach it.

                    * Sex is a component of relationships. Are their relationships more successful? How many divorces? How many long-term happy marriages?

                    * Study communicated that the pill causes more teenage pregnancies - perhaps because more people are having sex with unintended consequences

                        * Pill would imply, I can have sex without getting pregnant, then they do get pregnant.

            * Note that pregnancy is the result of knowing how to do sex. It is the intended biological consequence of sex. Pregnancy is doing sex right. Pretending otherwise seems naive.

            * In Egypt, it is the Islamic schools which teach sex education - with a focus on scriptural basis for sexual hygiene practices.

                * This seems a very good focus of sex education

            * Porn Generation - Sex education also normalises sex, rather than making it a privilege, which would also lead to the normalisation of abortion, as pregnancy then becomes an unwanted thing that you can get rid of your convenience, rather than something wanted/intended/desired from the sex which is something the stance "don't have sex unless you want kids and are married" communicates

    * It seems the left/liberals has gain preference in western world, because the right/conservatives has had to go through an existential crises the past 20-60 years as due to the rise of technology, science, and secularism, it has been harder and harder to believe in a fantasy man in the sky, which a lot of their morality was based upon, so when you have repressed a liberal into a conservative system from the argument of god, and god can be questioned, then the liberal will not stay.

        * As such, a lot of SJWs seem to have come from more repressive religious communities, where without questioning how they were able to be manipulated by cult like behaviour, they've swapped out the previously socially acceptable cult, for a new socially acceptable cult, which has the same dogmatic and expansive belief systems (the overarching patriarchy, marxism, etc)

        * The right/conservatives as a party, and as individuals, have had to go through an existential crises, to question why they do things, and what is it about, and hence the focus now on secular reasoning, individual responsibility, and benefit to society - as the god reason is no longer enough

            * Nietzsche's quote about the world is rife with suffering today, and a promise of a good afterlife is not adequate enough to ease importance of today's suffering

        * This seems cumulated by Trump winning in this election.

            * One reason can be individual agency and conservatives have been neglected for so long. And the rest of the republican party are still outdated for today's world.

            * Also a note, that it was not a "not hillary" vote.

                * Has also happened in Egypt, with the failure of the old regime.

* Self authoring improvements, especially for men

    * Seems related to the masculine role being shattered over the past 60 years. Where women's role has been strengthened into a very coherent story, and the masculine role has been weakened, where they have no coherent story besides being rapists and toxic.

    * Eliminates the assumption that socio political / cultural interventions must be required, over individual psyche interventions.

        * You do not have to change the system

        * You can change the individuals

            * And from that, even the system changes

        * Causes may still be socio political, but it does not mean the solution has to be!

        * We should still strive to address socio political factors as well - but we can weigh up the multiple factors, and address multiple factors, and consider individual psyche changes as one option

    * **Observations of men and women communication differences in social situations**

        * Men with men will often smack talk, and talk about systems and opinions

            * disagreements, resolution, responsibility, encouragement

                * Good to see this smack talk celebrated in the jordan peterson discourse lobby

                    * In male workforce industries, this still exists in lunch breaks. But even women equalised work forces, even this masculine display in lunch breaks is condemned as a "toxic bros club".

                        * Feminist; argh, ew, why are they so aggressive?!

                        * Feminine; great, they are becoming stronger

        * Men with women will talk about each other; hopes and dreams (goals and ambitions), and concerns and encouragement

            * responsibility and encouragement

        * Women with women will talk about people and experiences and how others disappointed them to appeals of sympathy

            * complaints, sympathy, and encouragement

        * These differences seem to be due to

            * Disagreeableness in men, making them more competitive, seeking to make themselves and their social circle stronger

            * Agreeableness in women, making them more avoidant of conflict and sympathetic to their social circle

            * **_Follow-up: Are women more aesthetically focused than men?_**

                * Women seem more focused on aesthetic of beauty, and judge themselves, men, and other women on this. As well as the aesthetics that they can get from men / their men (government / family) / their man (marriage).

                    * What can help them get a man, raise a family, and enable their family/community, more productively

                    * Women must display to be attractive, they need to look perfect and display they would be a good wife/mother

                * Men seem more focused on aesthetics of women, and aesthetic of tools

                    * What can help them get a woman, raise a family, and enable society, more productively

                    * Men must perform to be attractive, they need to perform perfectly to showcase wealth, responsibility, and protection

                * This focus makes sense to apply with modern politics as

                    * Women are wired to judge the material possessions of men, as they are wired to want some of it

                    * And the men are now, wait, what, we earnt that, and you are not wife nor the mother of my children, stop taking my stuff!

* Gender and responsibility

    * Men and women are biologically different, temperamentally different

        * Difference for agreeableness is injustice and unfairness

            * Leads to the desire to make everyone androgynous

                * Women are pressured to behave as men

                * Feminists shame women into feminism

                    * For the goal of equality -Why are they so obsessed with equality? What is so special about equality? Who cares?!

                        * Perhaps it is a replacement of the religious dogma of work hard to get to heaven, instead work hard to get equality

                            * People must fight for something. People die for even garbage causes.

                            * If you equate money to power, then if you have less money, then you have less power, and if you have less power, then you can be exploited - not as simple as this though, there are other ways not to be exploited, and power is in more ways than just economic power, and also other ways to gain power than just money

                    * What if women fought for the right to vote on other grounds than equality? 

                        * We are competent enough - we can contribute, we also have helpful ideas about how society should be.

                        * Focus on proving that we can bring something positive instead of saying it is unfair if we don't get to vote, since men get to vote.

                        * Proving it by expressing good arguments and new perspectives that would benefit society.

    * Confusion between equality and equivalence and equity

        * Definitions

            * Equality - the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities

            * Equivalence - equal in value, amount, function, meaning, etc

            * Equity - the quality of being fair and impartial

        * Women fought to be equal to men (right to vote, right to work), now they are, and in many ways surpass men legally, as such perhaps now they are fighting for equivalency instead - which is delusional, as they are not, nor why would a woman want to be man?

            * Why fight feminism as a woman, when it gets you want you want, and as you don't like conflict yourself.

            * Ties into earlier conversations about women, happiness, workforce, sacrificing their own family and local community around that family for a faux-workplace-community/family, satisfying maternal needs in places where maternal needs may not be best

            * Differences are there, for very good reasons

            * Fat Pizza - in Australia there has existed a large effort in celebrating not only cultural differences but even the worst parts of cultural differences (for Americans, think Russell Peters). Whereas now, you cannot even admit the worst part of cultures. Differences have become a taboo, rather than a celebration. 

        * Women also have the trump card that they can be pregnant, something a man can never do. As such, if they are fighting for equivalency, then it would also naturally lead into "we don't need men, as we can do all the things you can do, and more" - which trivialises the differences, the need for the differences

        * Equity applies the moral fervor to differences, viewing differences as unfair or unjust, even if they are also inevitable. How even the thought of nature-determinism is racist, despite it being true and non-negative of nature-determinism (their preference), you must acknowledge differences exist, and they may have good reasons why they exist.

    * There are forms of equity that cannot be measured, such as dignity, respect, discipline

        * In a circle of friends, their wealth changes over time, but they remain good friends and help each other, each becoming more successful over time, despite fluctuations in many measurable things

            * When a woman challenges a man, the man can turn it into a battle. If a woman elevates the man, he will do all sorts of things to please her. (probably goes the other way too)

                * Men will do things for a woman, that he will never do for a man.

                * Another approach women could take to equity, is to fulfill their feminine role with a person who is fulfilling a masculine role, as then the equity can also be shared

                    * They don't have to coerce men to give women more

                    * They don't have to act like men to get more

                    * All are options

                * Are women undervaluing respect for men?

                    * It seems in a large part, they are oblivious from this question. As seen by the anti-MRA lean. Mens issues do not seem to cross their mind outside of a feminist point of view.

        * There is one form of equity, than a man will never have, and that is the ability to get pregnant, this a traumatic disparity of equity

            * This is something that feminists look at deceptively

                * They view it as they women no longer need men

                * They also selectively ignore that it also innately acknowledges females femininity, and their role as a mother

                * The happiness of this point should be noted, as studies show

                    * Men acting like men makes men happy

                    * Women acting like men makes them unhappy

                    * Women acting like women makes them happy

                    * Men acting like women makes them unhappy

                    * (of course, obviously, they are exceptions to this, probably temperamentally based exceptions, so the ability to do what is right for you, is best)

            * Tangent of polyamory vs monogamy

                * Cost of pregnancy is more to the woman, than the man

                * Polyamory works were tribes raise the children

                    * Polyamory does not scale in modern day when everyone is pregnant with each others babies, only sustains in an unnatural hedonistic state of pregnancy avoidance

                * Monogamy works where wealth is propagated from families - rise of agriculture based societies

                    * Man - I will clothe and home you, and care for you in old age, with my and my ancestors rewards from our work - and you in exchange will guarantee the child is mine, take care of the things I neglect, and take care of me in old age

                        * Otherwise the male risks sacrificing his lineage for someone else's

                        * Otherwise the woman risks being impoverished

                * Genetic proclivities

                    * The larger the penis, the more promiscuous the ethnicity

                        * Sperm must compete with other sperm, women sleep with multiple men, the male who pleases the woman best gets her pregnant, and her vaginal juices will act as a spermicide to more inferior males

                    * The smaller the penis, the more monogamous the ethnicity

                        * No need for huge penises

    * Postulation: What would have happened if women, instead of arguing for the right to vote because they like men are breathing, instead arguing for the right of to vote because they will demonstrate they are competent and responsible enough to contribute to society in such a way.

        * This is in the context of conscription. Men had to be willing to sacrifice their lives for their country, and in exchange of that sacrifice, they get to vote. Women didn't have to do that.

            * Follow up; how would one demonstrate their competency, how would this be measured, would it be measured from a masculine or feminine perspective?

                * Voting is about opinions. So demonstrating your opinions stand against criticism. That we are women and we can make good arguments that stand against criticism, and this demonstrates our ability to have reasonable opinions, and to vote. Rather than we are women, and we should get to vote, because feelings.

                    * It seems the way they have ended up going about this, is the exact opposite - to try and tear down the scientific system as it is patriarchal, and that feelings trump facts.

        * Postulation: Do we really have a right to influence something, if we only influence it in bad ways?

        * There has been a large emphasis from feminism on ever expanding rights, but no emphasis on ever expanding responsibilities.

            * One could consider themselves to have no rights, and only privileges they have earned from demonstrating responsibilities.

                * Ha! Like the Stack Exchange and Discourse moderation systems.

* Free will

    * If two set of conclusions can be drawn from the same experience, then you cannot say it was the experience that caused the conclusion. If you were bullied as a child, you can either grow up to never bully someone again or grow up to bully everyone - since both of these situations can happen, and be modified by individual intervention, it was not the experience that enforced the outcome, but the agency of the individual

        * Not that experience alone, but other experiences together with your biology will necessarily lead to one future (determinism).

            * You can't change the past, but the future is still open - an intervention can change a person’s future behaviour.

                * Your future is also, your responsibility, it is no one else's

        * If the individual does not realise it was their doing, then they require an intervention (usually in the form of seeking psychological help when their happiness gets too bad, or a court enforced intervention if their crime gets too bad)

            * *Seems this is why books like "Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill" does so well for making successful people.* As it teaches them their actions are the result of their character which is a result of their choices, conscious and unconscious, and while they cannot change the past, they can change their future, by changing their character, through awareness and goal setting and integrity.

    * Sam Harris - how do you have free will, when you can't even control your thoughts

        * Imagine some doves. Who decided how many doves you imagined?

        * Notice your observational thoughts, the thoughts you did not call upon. Who put them there? They seem to just arise out of nowhere.

        * As an side

            * Think and Grow Rich also touches on this, they have two concepts of imagination - synthetic (ones that you assimilate) and creative (ones that stem from you) - they also have two concepts of knowledge, specialised and general

                * [http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr10.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr10.htm) - knowledge

    * *Follow-Up:* If free will is defined as existing outside of causality (contra-causal free will), what *is *it? It isn't randomness and it’s not caused by anything (or at least, there is a non-causal part of it) - what else is there? 

    * If free will doesn't exist, moral responsibility has no solid ground.

        * True, but it is helpful to think of responsibility as a tool. You hold others responsible to make them act better and you hold yourself responsible in order to improve yourself.

        * There is still a problem there - moral responsibility depends on free will existing.

        * We punish criminals because we hold them responsible - we don't punish animals or nature in the same way, because we don’t consider them to have agency.

            * We punish criminals to condition them and to deter others - that depends on people acting predictably, it depends on at least some level of causality.

            * We hold humans responsible because we can interact morally with them - we can even hold dogs responsible to a degree since we can interact morally with them. 

    * Definition mashups. Lets define; Free will vs choice vs agency vs destiny vs fate

        * Free will - are our choices our own? Is everything pre-decided? God only knows/decides.

            * Whatever the answer, it has zero utility, as we are subject to it and won't be able to manipulate it.

        * Agency - regardless of free will, we still appear to make choices, which forces upon us the utility of agency, responsibility and morality - the limit of our agency is how accountable we are held in the eyes of the law - as well as the limit of our ability to self-actualise?

            * Certain animals (humans, dolphins, elephants, and others) display sophisticated morality

            * Dogs (and others) display basic morality, dogs will protest, if they do the same work as another dog and do not get rewarded in like

                * [Why Vegan? Lessons From An Animal Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZYQnt-67vs)

            * Some animals seem to display no morality

        * Destiny - what is our divine purpose

        * Fate - what is our human limit

    * Biblical reference

        * Humans were like animals and had no free will, until they ate from the tree of knowledge, and gained consciousness/agency/responsibility

    * Matrix movies and free will

        * The matrix movies are a testimony to the realisation of man's agency against parental care. The ending attests to this - with a peace between the machines and the humans - those who exercise their agency may voluntarily leave the comfort of the matrix and fend for themselves in the chaos of the real world - however before the ending, it is also a testament to man's drive for agency and self actualisation - the scenes between neo and the architect, the oracle, and smith explain this - with only neo and this team believing in the power of agency, and through this belief, and the architects disbelief of it, they are able to convince the oracle of the power of neo’s agency and conquer smith, and survive the humans who wish to tear them down (cipher from the first movie).

            * To be is to be perceived. And so to [know](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Know) thyself is only possible through the [eyes](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eyes) of the other. The [nature](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nature) of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our [words](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Words) and [deeds](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Deeds) that go on apportioning themselves throughout [all](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/All) [time](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Time). **Our ****[live**s](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Life)** are not our own; from womb to tomb, we are bound to others, ****[pas**t](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Past)** and ****[presen**t](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Present)**, and by each crime and every kindness we birth our future.**

                * This is an acknowledgement of nature's role in our determinism and chose our own path, but then it is also an acknowledgement of the power of our agency and human spirit to guide our path (and shape the future, for us, and others) as we see fit

                    * The past has shaped the environment of the game, you now get to pick how you wish to play it, and change it for the future generations

        * As an side, I really like this quote

            * **You have to do whatever you can't ****_not_**** do.**

## [Personality #9](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-9/56/1), [#10](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-10/57/1)

* Contraceptives, do we believe what Peterson says?

    * Biological / attraction

        * Milo Yiannopoulos 

            * [http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/08/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-and-crazy/](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/08/birth-control-makes-women-unattractive-and-crazy/) 

        * Wikipedia's pages on sexual attraction and pheromones in humans also cover this

* Workforce and happiness implications

    * Peterson also mentioned somewhere, perhaps the lecture below, that the lightbulb was the work multiplier for men, whereas the contraceptive was the work multiplier for women

    * Maps of Meaning 2017 Lecture 09

        * 1:21:00 - the older you get, the more important family is - the utility of your career peaks at around 35 - you need family for support at around 50 and especially at 80 - the birth control pill / female contraceptive allowed females to compete in the same arenas as men - well done feminism - it is a very rare woman who doesn't have a primary desire in their 30s to have children, it is a woman with severe issues who doesn’t  

* Social implications

    * Relation to Victorian age

    * Hysteria

        * Perhaps due to their neuroticism? Neuroticism in women seems to manifest in crying and vocal dissatisfaction, in order to have others fix their problems for them - hysteria seems an extension of this

            * Crying biologically driven to invite others in to help you when you can't help yourself

                * Men cry less, as they win the women by solving their problems

                * If men were to cry, no one would solve the problems, they'd only "accept" them - every single female driven support group ever

            * Crying pheromones [http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110106/full/news.2011.2.html](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110106/full/news.2011.2.html) 

* Beta males vs alpha males - how do men view it?

    * It seems something we accept and enjoy, a fun aspect of our drive - wrestling, sports, etc

    * Betas seem to accept their position, and even demonize masculinity - defining feminists in indefensible situations

    * Also seems a cultural situation, russia is still very alpha driven, other (western?) nations are becoming more feminine

    * Perhaps as women become more masculine, men must become more feminine to counterbalance this

    * More single mothers, more feminine men

* Avoiding birth control makes you more careful

    * No birth control, you avoid situations which you are at risk of rape (drugs, alcohol, night walking, alone, clothing, etc) - victorian era and in islam, where one wore plain clothing (perhaps due to men having less self control)

* Anima, animus

    * Where do you think this corruption comes from?

    * Does love reinsert?

    * Negative and positive aspects of both masculinity, and femininity

        * If one only encounters negative of one, then that may be all they see, and they may stereotype it and reject it

            * Mothers with abusive relationships, injecting their bias and experiences into the child

            * Child then rejects everything from that abusive character, rather than just seeing the bad, they must also see the good

        * If one is in love, seems they incorporate the positive aspects of the opposite, to the dance of love

            * Accept the flaws in each other, and take the best of each other into themselves - tell the truth no matter how painful

    * Women can control men by their nature, how do men control women?

* Eastern europe and safe spaces

    * Safe spaces / gender vs sex / is very strange to eastern europe

    * Sweden, the whole country, is a safe space - they avoid conflict and seek to agree on everything

## [Personality #7](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-7/54/1), [#8](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/personality-lecture-8/55/1)

    * Lectures resonated with everyone in the group, mostly from the archetypal narrative it injects into the everyday

    * Courage to Fail

        * Courage to confront demons

        * Courage to try new things

        * When to draw the balance of putting skeletons in the closet, versus dealing with them

            * Sometimes it seems beneficial to put skeletons in the closet and move on with one's life

                * New relationships, new beginnings, leaving the past behind you

                * Simba running away as a kid

            * Sometimes it seems beneficial to confront demons head on

                * Therapy

            * Seems about strength and abilities of the individual at the time, and also if those demons can be left aside, or whether they will grow if unattended

    * Discussion of conflict within different cultures

        * USA seems to be focused on interpersonal conflict (identity vs identity)

        * Europe seems to be focused on governmental conflict (socialism vs capitalism)

    * India vs China

        * LiveLeak has videos of accidents occurring in India and the entire village runs to help

        * LiveLeak has videos of accidents occurring in China, and people continue as if it is an inconvenience to help

        * Initial postulation was due to the shear number of people in China, perhaps they don't value life as much, as there are so many of them everywhere - however this is also true about India, so that rules that out

        * Second postulation then evaluated the emotions/motivations of the acts

            * That perhaps China's communism has driven out such spiritual influence, and left the people more nihilistic, and self interested

            * However, we are all self interested, but it seems that the difference there could be that western/christian culture indicates that helping others even without direct benefit to yourself, can help the group, and may help you, fulfilling altruistic self-interest - such as the "golden rule" in christianity - india perhaps has this through the western/christian influence, or perhaps hinduism has it - whereas perhaps china's ideology takes that away from its people

## [1984](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/george-orwell-1984/70/1)

* Censorship of language, and thus expression

    * Tech/liberal world promotes "accessibility" of language, limiting the ability to express complex ideas

    * Far-left individuals, organisations, media and government pick their words very carefully

        * "Race" is now any group of people distinguishable by any feature, physical, mental, or intellectual

        * Affirmative Action = Political Nepotism

        * Social Justice Warrior = Autocrat

* Historical revision

    * Examples from the book

    * Examples in the media - articles being revised and changing since original publication, sometimes dramatically

    * Examples within government - holocaust narrative vs holocaust facts - gender theory in schools and bill nye - history from north korea

* Destruction of romantic ideals of human spirit, with replacement of "self-interest" realisation

    * Instances of chinese people running people over, and thinking of it as an inconvenience

    * Instances of indian people being hurt, and entire village runs to their aid

    * Seems that west vs east has different perceptions of self interest

        * West - doing good by others does good by yourself - others are an extension of yourself - peterson echoes this christian message

        * East - you win at the loss of others???

        * Capitalism - you win at the assistance of others

* Orwell predicted china, but did not predict the west, why?

    * Role of technology being an equaliser force for the people, preventing authoritarian regimes… for the time being - as in the last 10 years, companies like facebook and google have the potential to be propaganda agents for political goals

* When one is equal in wealth, it amplifies the difference in power

    * Socialism just redistributes scarcity at worse result for everyone

    * Capitalism promotes innovation which works to solve scarcity

    * Governments/societies should be focused on fostering innovation, reducing the need of jobs, and living well - rather than spurring the economy via "dog eating its own tail" dynamics

    * Revolution should occur by deprecating the cause of the problem, not by changing hands of the problem

        * Thoughts on new governmental system as a result from economic viability from inevitable technical innovation - [https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/government-as-volunteers-implementing-digital-voted-for-policies-some-thoughts-71a18f3b9977](https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/government-as-volunteers-implementing-digital-voted-for-policies-some-thoughts-71a18f3b9977) 

* Automation and jobs, what jobs will remain

    * Aptitudes and proficiency, vs ineptitude and SJWism

        * Ben's notes

            * "In a world where nerds like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are the most powerful innovators, speech codes seem like the revenge of the anti-nerds."

            * I often wonder that if SJWs put their 10,000 hours into code, rather than into activism, then they'd probably not need their activism.

            * Considering that a computer science degree starts of with 400 students, and by 3rd year is 30 students left with others moving to degrees better suited to their aptitudes, it makes me think the inability to put into the hours to gain the necessary skill level for their desired reward level, may actually be an aptitude issue.

            * As such, it seems to me that the SJW objective is actually to mend aptitude shortcomings with social justice regulation in order to obtain equal outcome through marxist imposition regimes.

* Could the chinese communist party ever have a revolution from within? It seems not, they seem to be 1984's IngSoc perfectly - they control the education, the languge, the media, and the expresison of people - leaving no room for protest, and perhaps no ability to think about protest - [https://torrentfreak.com/apple-bans-vpns-from-app-store-in-china-170729/](https://torrentfreak.com/apple-bans-vpns-from-app-store-in-china-170729/)

## General Discussion

* Covering anything Peterson, now that we finished the maps of meaning series

* What does Peterson consider god? What is god?

    * Quotes

        * Lecture 07 1:08:00 "God is the spirit of civilisation"

        * Lecture 11 09:30 "God is the spirit of the great father, is the conceptualisation of what one bargains with with for rewards in their game"

        * Lecture 8 1:43:00 "The gods of abstractions compete in the manifestations of the tribes"

        * Lecture 8 1:57:00 "The first god of theirs (marduk) had the power of words"

    * Musings

        * Religion/feminism/marxism/nihilism/peterson all have different conceptualisations of what is the spirit of civilisation, and how to play the game of responsibility

            * Abrahamic religions

            * Feminism - feminine vs the patriarchy - your shortcomings are the patriarchy's fault

            * Marxism - the proletariat vs the bourgeoise - your shortcomings are capitalism's fault

            * Peterson - your shortcomings are your fault, start with addressing them

        * Responsibility

            * Accepting responsibility for everything is overwhelming

            * Accepting responsibility for nothing is hedonistic

            * Not playing the game of responsibility is nihilistic

            * Peterson: Play the game of responsibility for things you can reasonably impact, start with yourself and work from there

        * Groupthink

            * As religions became harder to believe in, people moved their delegation of responsibility to other forms of groupthink

            * Must take ownership of our own responsibility

        * Personalities

            * Do cultures/ethnicities have different personalities that impact god belief, or groupthink?

                * High openness, and low agreeableness - seem to be lack of susceptibility to these (challenges ideas and doesn't do anything they don’t consider valid)

                * Low openness and high agreeableness - seems to be the susceptibility to delegate agency to appease peers (doesn't challenge ideas, respects people too much)

        * Afterlife

            * Some musings on that that I can't remember

        * Disciplining Children / Authority / Sociopaths / Guilt / Shame

            * Telling children "because I said so": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toRV6ziOYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toRV6ziOYg)

## [Maps of Meaning #12](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-12/34/1)

* Moral relativism

    * You can compare moral systems/rules to see which function better

* Objective/subjective morality vs. universal/relative morality

    * Universal morality is something that everyone or every society agrees on or which works in all societies

    * Relative morality is based on subjective opinions on morality which differ between groups/societies

    * Objective morality is

    * What does objective mean in this context? Exists irrespective of a perceiver? How can it exist without humans then?

        * Evolutionary perspective - what will make you or your society successful is objectively good (What about conflicting adaptations?)

        * A society which thrives during a long period of time has a good moral system

        * You can have a subjective goal and build objectively good ways to achieve that goal based on the subjective premise (your goal)

* How do you know if you have made an error?

    * You often act based on an estimation of how likely you are to succeed. If you don't succeed, that might just mean that you gambled and you lost - not that there is anything wrong with you map.

    * These situations might be difficult to distinguish from real cases of insufficient maps. How do you know which ones are errors and which ones are lost gambles?

    * Possible consequence: you recalibrate your map into something less successful (Example discussed later in the discussion: You drive your partner in a car → another car drives into you → your partner dies → you take responsibility for the death, meaning → you never drive again = unreasonable, since the risk of getting into an accident is fairly low.)

* Playing games that are voluntary by everyone involved will outcompete enforced games

    * Compare SJWs

    * Virtual reality is a game which removes the constraints of other people cooperating and reality

        * Will people choose to compete in the virtual reality once it becomes too much like reality?

        * Will people try to pursue sexual/romantic partners or just get a robot or a virtual experience? 

            * Reality is still more meaningful than a fantasy.

        * Would people choose to live in a matrix if they had the choice?

            * Maybe not possible.

* Even small problems can become important - rule of 3

    * If someone does something that you find disruptive, and it occurs 3 times, then you will confront the other person

    * Not ignoring it and get to the bottom of it 

    * You push away the objections 3 times

    * They get mad and they burst into tears or get angry, and you push that aside

    * Then you can solve the problem as you've gotten to the depth of it - not be intimidated by anger, and not to be swamped by compassion by the tears

    * Good way for agreeable people to make sure they deal with problems that they should deal with

* If you continue to agree to be a slave, then you continue to generate tyrants - tyrants will push until someone pushes back

* You should let go of anything interfering with your psychological progression, as however valuable what you have is it is still not as valuable as what you can get

    * How do you know what is worth letting go of? You have to be practical, to some degree.

    * How should you know how to prioritise? Self-authoring program could be a start.

* Sometimes you don't know the best possible action → choose to say what you think and define the result of that as the best possible outcome

    * Consequences of telling the truth can be terrifying. However, they are often not as bad as you imagined.

    * If you upset someone that you don't agree with at all and don’t identify with (e.g. Nazis), it won’t bother you. However, if you upset the group that you identify with most, then their resulting negative view of you might affect *your* view of yourself.

* You don't take responsibility of the things you don’t accept, you only take responsibility of things you choose to accept

    * When you don't accept responsibility for something that is your responsibility, you are hiding it

    * Responsibility can be viewed as a tool that you use to make yourself better in future situations → take responsibility for the bad actions that you could change to act better in a similar future situation (e.g. genetic illness → no responsibility, nothing you could have done).

    * Take responsibility for other people by telling them when they are acting wrong - otherwise, you rob them of the opportunity to get better

* You should turn into a monster, but voluntarily, with the good in mind

    * Not be timid and naive - predators go after timid victims

* Encountering malevolence

    * Personal stories

    * Naivety - not a broad enough term?

    * You don't have any space in your map of the world for that malevolence

    * What could you do about it? 

        * Look for signs before - sometimes there are no signs of malevolence before it reveals itself

        * Handle the situation - not be too timid, use the tools you do have instead of expecting someone else to solve the situation for you

    * Make people braver - not less afraid

* You don't keep the snakes away from your children - you give your children tools to chop up the snake and make the world out if it

    * Difference between Australia and Sweden: Sweden seems to be more afraid of letting children experience distress (e.g. "hate" on the internet). In Australia, parents less concerned and give their children an ipad.

    * Taking responsibility as an adult - can be a large step from being a child

        * Some might handle it by doing all the irresponsible things one can think of and some might be terrified of the responsibility

        * Letting children practice taking responsibility

* Some people want to hide behind an authoritative person or entity that is providing them with protection. They don't want to accept the realisation that you are the person who knows best what you should do (frightening, because what do you know?)

    * You can't stand up to the person who is providing you with protection, because you don’t want to lose that protection.

    * When people are becoming less afraid, they start standing up to people in a way they never expected

    * Connected to agreeableness? Afraid of social consequences - want people to like you.

    * Mentioned by Peterson in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHuxVvA7T8): Make sure you have alternatives if you want to be able to express views that others might not accept (in the context of work, but could be applied to friendships as well)

        * These discussions can help with that → dare to express views in other contexts, as one knows that there are people who will accept one's views

* Safe spaces

* Why people are not having children

    * In Australia, people don't seem to want to have children. Leave them with a nanny.

    * In Sweden, people seem to want children, but are not in a stable relationship and lack the financial stability.

    * In Colombia, people are having children early.

    * Women seek other ways to fill their life with meaning → career

        * Women try to attract men the way men attract women (with status/resources)

        * Does it work? Men seem to value financial independence. 

        * Why? To not get tricked (used for money). Because having two incomes makes a big difference. To make sure that she will have something to rely on if he disappears (e.g. dies).

* Dreams

* Contradictions in the bible: sacrifice completeness for coherence, like dreams. 

* Genesis

* Religion: how do we know if there is a god or not?

* Western individualism: the group serves the individual, because the individual revivifies the group - if the individual is subordinate to the group, the group stagnates.

    * Why? Because reality is too complex for an individual to understand → we need individuals with different ideas/approaches → it will be visible which individuals have the best ideas/approaches → the group can be revivified.

    * If the group is superordinate to the individual, the group will decide on a direction → because of the complexity of reality, it is unlikely to be the correct direction → no chance of changing, since individuals are subordinate → the group stagnates.

    * No direction can be correct and stay correct, since the world changes → you need to be able to adapt → that's why stagnation is dangerous.

* Why is having children (in some parts of the world) not viewed as something praiseworthy?

    * Everyone has children → not difficult or exceptional, just normal

    * Viewed as something good by relatives, but not by society

    * Society views having children as a personal decision which is selfish (you do it because you want to and not in order to benefit someone else - not necessarily selfish as in bad for others).

        * Not entirely wrong - people have children for their own benefit and not for the benefit of society - but it is an incomplete view, since children benefit society. Also, the children themselves benefit, since they get to live.

* Uncertainty (back to the question about why people are not having children)

    * People have options today that they didn't have before → responsibility, because it is your fault if you make the wrong decisions.

    * The responsibility might make people fear uncertainty.

    * The fear of uncertainty leads people to take precautions (e.g. women making sure they are not financially dependent on their partner), which results in fear of having children, not being able to have as many children or not having children.

        * These precautions might make people less dependent on each other in a relationship → higher risk of ending the relationship

* Parents separating after having children 

    * The new partners of the parents create complexity

    * Not good for the children (higher cortisol level, fight over territory, fight over attention from the parent).

* Belief systems and games

    * A mutual belief system supports mutual game playing, including cooperative competition, no way to avoid fighting, but best way to reduce is to converge belief systems

    * A different belief system results in these options

        * Capitulate / disengage

        * Fight

        * Negotiate: Identify presuppositions, find similarities and differences

    * Australia

        * Has always had a values test

        * Recently cancelled a economic migration visa due to right wing rise

* Peterson's communism rant

    * When two ideas are in conflict, find the central value/theme, and if they are shared in aspirations, they can integrate - if they can't, it’s if not impossible to do

        * Communism has organic development, and rational

        * Western values/ideas are ancient - core idea is god, and implementation is values

    * When a core idea is taken out of a civilization, the civilization starts falling, which is what Neiche predicted with western civilisation - as such, we must find a transcendent value

    * What is a transcendent value? How do we make it less amorphous?

    * Ideas vs ideologies

        * Ideologies seems to be ideas that manifest themselves in our worldview / how we act in the world

        * Modern feminists seem to have incredible depth of feminism, but lack of breadth of other ideologies, thus why different ideas challenge them

## [Maps of Meaning #9](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-9/31/1)

* Video by An Ear for Men

    * He is correct that Peterson has not conducted a survey of MGTOWs, so he has no evidence that it is older men who teach younger men etc.

    * He misinterprets what Peterson means by "women are telling you what's wrong with you" – it’s not what women say explicitly, but rather how they act (e.g. men around you who have better social skills, higher salary, etc. get women and you don’t → that’s what’s lacking).

    * A clue is when Peterson says something like "by definition, you're the problem" – he regards relationships as a fundamental part of life that brings meaning. If you can’t attract a partner or if you’re not satisfied with the partners you attract, the *helpful* conclusion is that you are doing something wrong. Opting out of the competition altogether will take away meaning.

    * How meaningful is it for unattractive, unsuccessful men who will never be able to attract a woman to try even though they will most likely fail? Is competing always the right decision?

        * How many are these unwanted men? 10-20%?

    * MGTOWs offer no solution – MRAs do (and Peterson too).

* Women could get children first and get an education later (suggestion from a student in lecture 9)

    * Makes sense, since women can get an education regardless of age, but they are fertile for a limited number of years

    * How finance it? Grandparents could help.

    * Problem: young people lack the knowledge and experience which might make a relationship last – might lead to a lot of divorces.

* Problems with feminism

    * Women want successful men to marry. If men are discouraged from getting successful, that is bad not only for them, but also for the women who would have married them.

    * Focuses mainly/exclusively on one gender → get only half of the picture (don't listen to men) → solutions to problems end up short-sighted

    * Women and men have different problems when they are looking for a partner or when they are in a relationship. If we just listen to the problems that women experience and reduce them, that might have unforeseen effects on how men act in those changed situations. The solution is to listen to men as well.

    * Feminism views women as tools to accomplish their goal of equality of outcome.

    * Suffragettes and the initial goals of feminism

    * First wave and second wave feminism were overall positive

    * Is feminism good for women?

* What makes a man marriageable?

    * From the woman's perspective: it depends on how desperate / selective she is.  It can range FROM 1) Being ready to act as a decor in the woman's life TO 100) being the highest possible in all possible dominance hierarchies.

    * Women are generally not desperate enough (hypergamy) → end up lonely

    * Physical attractiveness could be negative, used only for sex, but not husband material – less physically attractive men must put in effort in fulfilling the expectations of women (work on their character, get a high salary, etc.).

    * Money (provider role), social status and strength (protector role), physical attractiveness (gene quality).

* What do men seek in women?

    * Physical attractiveness

    * Youth/fertility

    * Chasity – less promiscuous women are preferred, since they are less likely to already carry another man's child or cheat later in the relationship. In the context of ONSs? Also less attractive if women show unwarranted interest.

* Identity

    * "you must have an identity that can withstand the most profound doubts in your life with equivalent force"“part of Peterson's goal is to protect your identity against ideological possession”

        * Identity at a macro and micro level; this applies for cultures in society, as well as for individuals

    * Shallow individuals and shallow groups do not like challenge as that screws their order structure and leaves them in chaos with no shield

    * Knowing why you do your traditions with many layers of questioning is your shield against doubts

* Vices and nourishment

    * In trepidation we seek nourishment

* We act out things that we don't understand

    * We "understand" things in many different ways: acting out, feeling, representing partly incorrectly

    * Abstract representation probably most high-level form of understanding

    * Thus, limiting what you consider legitimate knowledge to abstract representation → large part of knowledge has to be cut out

    * Animals have a form of knowledge, which might not be abstract representation

* The individual, culture and nature

    * There are positive and negative archetypes of each of these

    * Need all six characters to guard against ideologies (that lack half of the characters)

* Free will

    * Is there free will? What is free will?

    * Is determinism compatible with free will?

    * If causality is one force and randomness is another force, would free will be a third cause?

    * Not believing in free will creates problems with taking on responsibility.

        * You can take on responsibility (in a pragmatic sense) and it will help you, but since you don't have to, you might lack the motivation.

        * You can explain your behaviour and say "I couldn't have acted differently".

    * Impossible (practically) to find all causes of human behaviour.

* Female archetypes

* The history of Hungary

* Morality

    * You need to share norms/values in order to be in the same circle of morality (where you can demand things of others and they can demand things of you)

    * How can you listen to demands made by people who do not share the same values?

        * They put you outside of their moral circle, but want to stay inside your moral circle

    * In many situations, norms and values are not an issue (treating a patient in hospital - won't ask them about their values first)

    * All human beings share some basic values

    * Be at effect (the situation influenced) first when considering an anomaly 

* Archetypal stories

    * Cultures can only interact to the extent of the similarities of their cultures

    * Archetypes must be what our culture considers to be the ideal way of behaving

* Split-brain problem

    * Internal inconsistency - thinking one thing, saying another; causes:

        * Hemisphere differences

        * Sub-personalities

        * We pursue all ideals, just in different orders, for the circumstances we perceive

    * Is a battle we all face, the more chaos we take on, the more struggles with this we will have

    * Dreaming is also the way we rectify this, as well as expression/creativity

    * Mid-life crisis could occur when this was pushed away, and the internal battle turned into a war - the Scar and Simba on the top of pride rock - the fight can no longer be ignored, as the whole kingdom will fall, so the fight must now occur, and a victor must come or a treaty must happen

* You have to be willing to burn, to have the courage to grow (phoenix rebirth, forest fire)

    * Hell is somewhere you go, because you recognise your moral failures

    * Phoenix's perspective of its rebirth, it must have been terrified the first time, but the more it did it, the more it got the courage to continue to have humility, and courage, to grow and rebirth

* Ideas are real

    * Give a hallucinogenic to someone, or to a schizophrenic, and ideas are as real as anything else

    * From a brain chemistry level, ideas are just as real as anything else

    * Perhaps this is the value of archetypes and meta-narratives, to our conceptions as humans, they are just as real as anything else

    * I wonder which movies has explored this

        * In the matrix, if you die in the matrix, you die in real life

    * Lincoln movie / la dolce vita movie

        * Example where the woman could not tame the man

* Islamophobia / insults (insulting one's character) / insolence (not saluting an army general)

    * Appeal to sensitivities

    * Cost of not having insults

        * Can become the fascist you fear as you never learn about your own problems

        * People who lack the skill to express their ideas in a sensitive way would not be able to express their ideas if less sensitive expressions were not allowed

    * Exposing yourself to insults might make you more able to handle ideas that you find "insulting"

* SJWs and agency

    * Disparity is due to oppression rather than agency

    * Their ideologies allow them to escape the complexity of nuance, and they really dislike it when anomalies occur, as it the destruction of the categories - so instead of adjusting, they double down on their categorisation - the "systematic/institutionalized" ism is worse than we ever thought!

* The problem of complexity

    * We solve it partly by cooperating with other people

* Free speech and insults

    * How should insults be viewed in the context of free speech?

    * Not necessarily helpful, but impossible to draw a line between idea and insult – if insults are not allowed, that rule can be used to increase the restriction to include expressions that are definitely ideas.

* Incentive reward

    * School teachers in Sweden thought that there was too much competition in education – without competition, a lot of incentive reward would be lost.

    * There seems to be an idea (among some teachers) that every pupil/student should be equally successful and that this would be fair. However, people have different potential and a fair school system would create some students more successful than others.

    * Why do people think like this?

    * One possible reason might be that they view intelligence as connected to a person's value as a human being. Thus, creating equally intelligent students would help creating a society where everyone has the same human worth.

* Sweden - Tim Pool

* Agreeableness

    * Vs Competitiveness, Conflict

    * Assertiveness Training for high-agreeableness

    * Sensitivity Training for low-agreeableness

    * Male vs female differences

        * Males - want to eliminate the problem - perhaps due to fight vs flight threat response?

        * Females - want to relate the problem - perhaps due to tend & befriend threat response?

    * Agreeable people are liked, but not respected.

    *  Low in a social dominance hierarchy → need to be agreeable OR agreeable → not respected → low in social hierarchy?

    * Learn the rules → be agreeable → then, allow yourself to be more assertive and become respected (learn the rules of the game, play it and then change the rules)

* Male vs female differences

    * Male preference for activities

    * Female preference for non-activities

    * Seems related to neuroticism trait

        * High neuroticism is risk averse, so prefers non-activities, explains makeup link

        * Low neuroticism likes risk, so is okay with activities

* Islamic values and implementation versus western values and implementation

    * Islam is conservative values enforced with harsh legal penalties

    * Daniel Defoe - A treatise of marriage - chapter 1 - conjectures

        * Protection from temptations causes weak willpower, but more pure people

        * Exposure to temptations causes less pure people, more strong willed people

        * Jews do well on willpower, as have moral protections against high distractions

        * Christians generally fail on willpower, as low moral protections against high distractions

        * Muslims do poor on willpower, as protected from temptations from their state so no opportunity to develop individual resistance

* Free speech vs speech limits

    * Dangerous to allow it and dangerous to suppress it

    *  Individuals who are afraid of their own forbidden thoughts and banish them to the back of their mind, are they more likely to have the same view on a societal level = want to limit free speech?

    * Trusting the people enough to allow them freedom (of speech and other things). If you limit people's ability to decide for themselves, they become weak. If you allow them to build up their own self-control/willpower, some will fail and some will become strong.

    * The risk of free speech is that bad ideas can propagate fast and lead to violence – is it worth it?

        * If allowed, can be countered

        * If not allowed, will lead to an underground movement and resentment.

        * Violent ideas being able to propagate might be a symptom of a problem that the state should fix →  removing the symptom doesn't solve the problem, only hides it.

    * Seems western nations, thanks to education system, can trust their citizens more with ideas than countries with poor education systems

    * We limit the free speech of children via parental discretion (manners, respect, etc) and relax the restrictions as we recognise the child's intellectual development

    * Autism / theory of mind / words weapons

    * Two parents strapping a bomb to their 4 year old child, and telling them the devil is across the street and they must walk over there and press this button to go to heaven

        * These words are illegal in most countries, even western, as it is an incitement of violence against an impressionable crowd - however, if the children were educated adults, it would not be illegal words, as the adults have been granted the responsibility of agency, and thus we would persecute the adults on different grounds - their intentions, rather than their words

* Internet

    * Makes it possible for underground movements to grow if they are suppressed by a state (by limitations of free speech)

    * Things we don't want on the internet (e.g. child porn) will always exist in some form. What can we do about that?

* Lecture 6 - 1:47:00 - - jung: men go after perfection, women go after wholeness 

    * Seems when women entered the workforce, personal development has gone a lot more about wholeness, with the accident of pitching personal development styles on both genders, rather than gender specific

* Gender % in university degrees

    * Is there a gender % in SJW, and marxism, communism, postmodernism?

        * Evaluation of governments and companies

            * Seems tech companies may be ostracising the conservatives out of their companies, which is strange, as conservatives seem necessary for sustainable growth - something the tech world struggles with and even despises

            * European governments have been communist/socialist  before the woman workforce uprising

                * This is interesting, as it is - why now, are the social studies at the universities, mostly female, taking a liking to such ideas - were 60+ years ago, they were pushed by men?

                * Can this even be mapped to gender? Are europeans of dominant in certain Big 5 personalities that trend in both males and females that english founded countries are not? Are males and females in Sweden generally higher in agreeableness than Australians?

                    * This personality preference against countries would be fascinating

                        * Well that was easy - [Web Search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=big+5+personality+traits+by+country&t=osx&ia=videos#)

    * Hungary - holocaust denial is illegal

    * Australia - no problem, we really despise censorship, many foreigners come to our country and it is a shock, and commonly held beliefs and way of processing the world (institutionalised racism) are confronted and challenged, and their summary is bewilderment that we have a very multicultural country but appear so racist to them

    * Sweden - right-wing opinions are pushed underground, where they radicalise and grow, when open conversation about them will be able to counter and neutralise such opinions

    * Columbia - you can die for expressing a left-wing or right-wing opinion

* Cognitive dissonance

    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) 

    * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discrepancy_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discrepancy_theory) 

    * Should self vs ideal self vs actual self

        * When one leaves, we have the choice of moving the other two, or pulling the other one back in

        * This causes cognitive dissonance, which can be a short or lengthy process

        * If our ideal self leaves our should and actual, we need to build reasons to be our ideal (to move our should self to the ideal) and through actions make our actual self be considerable to our ideal self

        * If our ideal self is not possible/unrealistic/no-longer-relevant, it may be better to pull it back to the others

* Transcendence / how to identify goals

    * Feeling of fulfillment

        * David Foster Wallace - when I studied psychology, I felt 60% of me was engaged, when I did writing, 100% of me was engaged, so I chose writing (even though it was more difficult for me, it was also more rewarding and enlivening)

    * Relationships

        * Responsibility and meaning as the relationships we have with other entities and objects

        * Being a father/mother/parent or being just a good partner/husband/wife may be the most fulfilling things that many of us will ever do, and this is not a bad thing!

    * Defining transcendence - Tree vs butterfly vs ascension

    * Something worth living for - vs - Something worth striving for - vs - Something worth dying for

    * Sometimes death is worth the sacrifice in your framework of meaning

        * Braveheart (risking his life to free his nation)

        * The Fountain (commitment to his work)

        * Christopher Hitchens (smoking, drinking)

        * Islamic Suicide Bombers

* Timing discussion

    * Will be moving to Saturday 3pm GMT to make it easier for european time zones to stay awake, and more accessible to eastern time zones - and saturday as people have jobs

* Lecture 6 34:00 - competitors (all entities, including stars etc) make the world chaotic - as such the outside system is always changing to the systems we know << probably why people desire a heaven in a fantasy finite world of their making, or desire the end of the world to reduce complexity

    * Instead of suicide for overwhelming complexity, fantasies for changing the world to reduce complexity - prophecies, doomsdays, heavens

        * Noah's ark

        * Heaven

        * Mayan end of world prophecy

        * Religious mass suicides

* Ecology awareness and chaos awareness

    * Climate change, human awareness

        * Until we encounter an event that may challenge our framework, we take things outside our framework for granted

            * for instance, when we eat, we do not consider the economical and ecological process of the food, its infrastructure, transport, growing, farming, processing, filtering, the employees, their managers, their management software, their factories, the factory equipment, the employees at the factories, the systems in place for the internet to work and to provide electricity, the stable political climate for fuel exchanges between countries so that we have fuel for the transport trucks, etc

            * [http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/) contains some interesting notes about how we can take the ecological cost of food for granted

                * 1 hamburger = 2 months of showering

            * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0VHC1-DO_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0VHC1-DO_8) for fish caught by trawling

        * However, easy to forget the balance

            * If we go all the way one way - steppe nomad, or tribe in papa new guinea - completely environmental lifestyle but zero opportunity for improving the status quo

            * If we go all the way the other way - could also be problematic

            * [https://youtu.be/R8PEnK3aoFQ?t=4m25s](https://youtu.be/R8PEnK3aoFQ?t=4m25s) 

    * Nature worship vs human worship / Nature is not benevolent, it is apathetic, and tries to kills us as it competes with us

    * A lot of what we like about nature, is due to human intervention, human's control/taming of the chaos of nature/lion

        * Man man islands, shores, forests, etc

    * Electricity, internet, heating - all things here that society is built and maintains (millions of people) - to provide what we consider trivial things that we don't have to think about, until they break, and then they become incredibly complex

    * Army protects us and we don't even need to think about this

    * Beach bums that resent society forget that society protects them from the chaos, with the nurture to be a beach bum - army to protect, infrastructure for surfboard + wax + rashy + internet + iphone + food etc - all things that because they work, they are low resolution (but no less important) allowing them to focus at a high resolution on hedonistic pursuits

* 1:00:00 - facts rarely matter, as people's inherit ethics makes them select from the infinite amount of facts those that are relevant to you -[ Quora Question](https://www.quora.com/Do-I-have-a-moral-responsibility-to-challenge-certain-tenaciously-held-beliefs-if-I-find-that-they-are-based-on-shaky-evidence/answer/Jordan-B-Peterson)

* Left wing (people are irresponsible, we must regulate them)  vs Right wing (people are capable, we should empower them)

    * Tech industry

        * High openness and creativity - recently high agreeableness as women enter - very SJW world

    * Gender

        * Contraception did for women what the light bulb did for men

            * Light bulb allowed men to work into the night

            * Contraception allowed women to work instead of pregnant

            * Completely unforeseen consequence of a great liberation movement

        * Women voting meant now motherly values reflected in politics - rise of socialism/feminism in policy

            * Completely unforeseen consequence of a great liberation movement

        * Women getting degrees and going to uni means less mates attractive to them

            * Women mate same social status or up - so the more educated the female, the less available mates

            * Maternal ages can cause regret

            * Completely unforeseen consequence of a great liberation movement

    * Diversity of ideas vs diversity of values/identity

        * Sweden vs Hungary immigration issues

        * Employment quotas

            * Getting more people of the same identity could cause more people who think exactly the same - and potentially people with different values - the exact opposite of what successful systems need

                * [17 Dec 2016](https://twitter.com/balupton/status/810021305701515264) / [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSGd6Ojuw0Q&feature=youtu.be&t=36m15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSGd6Ojuw0Q&feature=youtu.be&t=36m15s) 

    * Politics

        * Ants by pixar criticises communism

        * Wall-e by pixar criticizes capitalism

* >36:00 - what we are doing with practice, is building new specialised machines in our brain, just like programming - our conscious is continuously programming our unconscious - the purpose of consciousness is to make us functional unconsciously - if you are good at something, you hardly have to be conscious of it at all - so consciousness is something like a error recognition and correction system

    * Very similar to programming, in programming we use our cognition to understand and problem properly and find a solution, and then automate the solution so we don't have to think about it anymore

    * Our mind is building cities with our thoughts, and the thoughts that we practice, our city workers strengthen to build freeways, changing the matter of our brain, and our perceptions

* Conservatives/victorian era vs modern day islam

    * Left-wing islam enforces conservative ideals on the population with severe punishments

    * Right-wing conservatism empowers individuals to grow (and fail) at reaching the ideals

* Nature and moral ideals

    * Clothes vs naked

        * In europe no clothes is problematic due to STIs and weather, as such the game of life does not reward those without clothes, so religion and ethics and societal standards are made that reinforce the moral duty of clothes wearing

        * In early encounters with island savages no clothes was not a problem, as no STIs (due to isolation) and warm all year round, so no need for the moral institution and shame practices of clothes wearing

        * Settles come to Australia, and nature will not reward their clothes wearing as it is too hot, as such they must change their expectations of decency or perish to the game of Australia's heat

    * Daniel Defoe - A Treatise of Marriage - [https://archive.org/details/treatiseconcerni00defo](https://archive.org/details/treatiseconcerni00defo) 

        * Page 4. "Nature and religion having introduced decency." Decency must mean a standard of acting for one's and society's benefit, which the aversion would introduce shame as the knowledge of the necessity for the standard removes the act from innocence.

        * "Modesty is the guard of virtue". Modesty must be the living within known and accepted constraints of decency from the laws of god/nature throws on us for the benefit of oneself and society.

        * Modesty is the first defence of virtue, when absent it is up to the law of men, then the command of religion, then the power of reason, to protect one from indecency, its consequences to oneself and society, from the mercy of nature. So many defences to protect us from the immense power of vice (man's shortcomings) and the passions of men (men as in mankind).

        * Virtue is the actions that make for profitable interactions under nature's laws. Decency is the state of abiding by those actions for divine benefit. Modesty is the desire to abide to avoid undue harm.

        * Divine benefit is the reward from nature's inherent ways and man's inherent ways. Divinity is a representation or understanding of those ways.

* 42:00 - when you know what you are doing, you want to be operating in high resolution - that is filtering out everything unnecessary to make the necessary super detailed - low resolution is when your focus is broad but blurry (scattered attention vs prolonged focus attention - at times, attention has to recharge and switch, to make sure it can still see the forest from the trees)

    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mamVI4UPYQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mamVI4UPYQ) good example of this

        * If you can argue your point without any "facts", then you know the high resolution reasons of why that argument/tradition/practice/concern/etc makes sense

        * If you your entire argument depends on disperse collections of "facts" all without any depth, then it is low resolution thinking

            * Daniel Defoe in the earlier mention book mentions this as a chimera, my notes:

                * Page 3. A chimera is a concept taking several things and putting them together in hopes that it is true but unlikely isn't. In modernity it is pseudoscience. It was used to describe the necessity for clothes from nature's harms and that those who use nakedness to communicate innocence over shame are wishful thinkers.

    * [Written Nov 27, 2015](https://www.quora.com/Do-I-have-a-moral-responsibility-to-challenge-certain-tenaciously-held-beliefs-if-I-find-that-they-are-based-on-shaky-evidence/answer/Jordan-B-Peterson) - this quora answer by peterson also stresses the importance of not arguing over fact collections, but over the inherent structures of arguments

        * 1:00:00 - facts rarely matter, as people's inherit ethics makes them select from the infinite amount of facts those that are relevant to you -[ Written Nov 27, 2015](https://www.quora.com/Do-I-have-a-moral-responsibility-to-challenge-certain-tenaciously-held-beliefs-if-I-find-that-they-are-based-on-shaky-evidence/answer/Jordan-B-Peterson)

    * However such debates are important, and temperament isn't everything, if someone is willing to discuss, you may be able to plant seeds, and if something  happens in their life, a catastrophe, that causes their current framework of operations to fail, then their cognitive error correction kicks in, and may use those seeds to create an updated framework version - unless one’s framework fails, there is no necessity to change it

        * peterson

            * <43:30 - a framework specifies; the current condition, the desired condition, and the behavioural manifestations that are necessary to make the transformation

            * <44:00 - motivations are the mechanisms that makes the world manifest themselves to you in keeping with your goals - they determine what is high resolution and what is low resolution, they determine the input you take onboard and the input you discard

            * 45:00 - a tool is a meaningful pattern

            * 47:00 - you can't derive ethics from facts, because there are an infinite size of facts, so which facts do you use? - by discriminating facts, you already are using an ethic, a process that is not based in facts

            * <49:00 - we see and describe the world in tools - meaningful patterns - knowledge can also be tools

        * Liberal (I'll do whatever I want, as long as it doesn’t hurt someone) to conservative (I’ll do what is best for society, even at the sacrifice of my own wants) to centrist (I’ll find the right balance between the cost of society and what is right for me)

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3m0tt5KcE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3m0tt5KcE) is the Reality and Sacred lecture from a different year, and is quite interesting and relevant to the 2017 Maps of Meaning lectures

* Teared down, rebuilding pieces, not the same person can be made as before

    * Desire to go home, as as a child you were built up - but going home as an adult, tears you down further into a child - due to the progress you made from child to adult

    * Mother without friends - not raising child to be independent integrated unit - but instead meaning and friend to mother

* Parental responsibility to create an integrated independent child

    * [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13286602-the-real-purpose-of-parenting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13286602-the-real-purpose-of-parenting) 

* Appeal to authority, disappointment, parents, adulthood

    * Being an adult is recognising that your parents views that are based on authority alone no longer matter

    * A parent loses meaning when the child becomes an adult - when the adult child does not listen to the aging parent - the parent may feel lost

* Anger, fear, fight or flight vs tend and befriend

    * Anger is an emotion of moral indignation expressed when you have control over a situation

    * Fear is a primal emotion

    * Resentment is anger unresolved

    * When angry, not possible for humility

* How to address anger

    * De-escalate with reason

    * Escalate with emotion

    * Diffuse with non-reaction - best for attention seeking behaviour (which could be sought from the use of anger)

    * Postpone with flee

* Oldness is the loss of play - playful old people are young at heart

    * In the talk Jose linked, Peterson also states that the story one experiences even, affects their thoughts on their age

    * One must embrace play, to enter chaos with humility, to learn

    * If one doesn't play, chaos is met instead with fear and resentment, to die

    * 1:45:00 - old can mean the lack of play - play is needed to do new things that you haven't done before - doing the same things will only last so long, before it becomes no longer fruitful

* Cowards aren't afraid of the dragons in you, but perhaps more the dragons in themselves

    * Example was insincere people - polite as a front - anger grows to resentment, as they are too afraid of confrontation (possibly discovering they are the monster in the mirror) they are not even willing to risk being the knight

    * Smugness of staying at home and judging the person who went on the pilgrimage and came back battered as not having it together - yet, the person who has fallen apart has so much growth that will be rebuilt into something greater than before - whereas the person who never ventured into chaos just slowly regresses - they never become something greater

        * 55:35 - the reason people tear things down is so they don't have to see the virtue they lack embodied in something - the embodiment is a contrasting reminder of what they lack - so the destruction of it, destroys the reminder, so they can be carefree

        * 1:13:00 - sometimes to escape, you have jump into the unknown, which is scary - when you go from a bad place to a better place, you go to a worst place first - that is a great thing to know, as it tells you why you might be unwilling to take the next step

        * 1:15:30 - you can't run back into who you are - as you are a new person with new experiences and knowledge

        * 1:24:00 - when you are rebuilding the broken pieces of your life, you are looking for the spirit needed to turn the unstable chaotic state in a new stable reality - this fantasy will make new things visible to you to help you on your journey

* Macro vs micro problems

    * 1:49:00 - you need to see the macro problem and the micro problems, and tackle both - if you just see and tackle the micro problem, you are doing busywork and are blind to your journey - if you just see and tackle the macro problem, they you get nothing done and make no progress towards solving it - never lose sight of the macro problem, because ending up lost in a bad place is worse than stagnating?

        * Seems both are equally important, I cannot imagine a situation where losing sight of one is better or worse than the other

        * Moral degradation seems to happen when the micro problem is the only focus, as one loses sight of their virtues and integrity, leading to arrogance

            * I've had this where I decide to play a video game for an hour, and it turns into 8 hours - something that doesn’t help me at all in my macro goals

        * When one just focuses on the macro problem though, the problem can become so overwhelming and they build a habit of stagnation so even the smallest feets become too much, and leads to resentment

* Perhaps the media consciously instills fear, anger, disgust - to impair our reasoning with the overflow of emotion - to make us zombies and sometimes even violent

* 1:30:00 - the more articulate person always rises

    * Always true

* Innovation

    * 1:52:00 - if you are unwilling to admit your insufficiency, then you will not be able to go on the pursuit to get help, ask the question, and seek the change - humility is the antidote to arrogance, as it means you still have something to learn and you are a student, an always honourable thing

        * This is super positive, as it shows humility as an opportunity for growth, rather than as a deficit

    * 1:54:00 - benevolence kills innovation, as benevolence is respect and admiration for the way things are - not what they could become > probably why frustration is such a good force for innovation!

        * Government's job should be to ensure technology is developed and utilised to ensure everyone can live well even if they are all unemployed!

        * People who are not willing to retreat in 40-60 year olds in trades replaced by computers, shouldn't vote for political parties that stifle innovation, but instead embrace play once again and retrain - although it may be too late to regain

## [Maps of Meaning #3](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-3/24/1)

* Shadows and personas, taming your inner monster, entering into chaos to discover your monster so you can harness it

    * May have been a monster originally, and then realised it was monstrous, and changed

    * May have not been a monster, and had to developer it to protect from other monsters

    * Finding balance is the important - too timid, monsters abuse you - too monstrous, no opportunities - balance takes time and diligence

* Lying / white lies / persona / society / honesty / makeup / cleaning / manners / virtues / success / faking / tradition

    * Cleaning example

        * Not cleaning your house at all

            * You get sick and people think you are a slob

        * Cleaning your house religiously

            * You have no spare time and people can think you are weird

        * Cleaning your house thoroughly only when others are around

            * Could be considered lying/disingenuous is not your natural state / putting up a front / bravado example - could also circumvent / muddy the waters / for natural improvements

                * However, if you are a mother with messy children, then this situation may be the best you can do, as the below example may not be possible

        * Cleaning your house regularly to maintain health, and occasionally thoroughly to maintain aesthetics for others

            *  Seems the middle balance through the above

    * Makeup example

        * No makeup provides the confrontation to build natural beauty in health, fitness and character - traits that can exist over time

        * However, aesthetic beauty diminishes over time - one may wish to use [feminine makeup, plastic surgery augmentations], [androgynous clothing], [male expensive watches, suits, cars, etc] to maintain their sexual marketplace value over time

        * To find balance

            * Makeup at the cost of developing natural beauty - is bravado and disingenuous

            * No makeup or efforts to improve aesthetics (shaving, haircuts, good clothes) - may lose societal standing

            * A mixture of aesthetics improvements and natural beauty/character improvements seems to be the middle ground

                * Aesthetic improvements to haircuts/shaving to look like your better self

                * Hygiene and character improvements to become a better self

    * Roles example

        * A home keeper housewife role may find a lot of meaning in maintaining aesthetics, as it is the role they have been assigned for their breadwinner - along with parenting if have children

            * it seems Jordan's thankfulness for makeup stems from this point

                * If one is married, naturally, having an aesthetically pleasing home and wife even in old age is nice and perhaps reduces temptations to look elsewhere

        * Bravado examples

            * Taking a loan to buy a porsche to appear aesthetically successful/attractive/appealing even though it is a white lie perhaps

                * May make it seem that success is only aesthetics, which is a very narcissistic way of seeing the world - Nicole Kidman's "To Die For" can portray this delusion

* Bull example

    * The spanish tradition of releasing a bull (a monster that represents chaos and destruction) to then tame by the human - can be of a lot of cultural significance - a right of passage for a man perhaps

        * However, when the tradition is lost into a situation where the dragon is caged and thousands of humans are destroying it, and cheating it, it seems to lose its honourable qualities

            * Especially when a man or men are destroyed by the monster/bull so the monster is just shot - this is embarrassing - the monster perhaps should be praised in admiration - although admiration is hard for cynics

* Destruction of building scene

    * Similar to riots around the world

        * The things the rioters dispise perhaps through resentful envy, are destroyed - rather than admired envy in the quest of a pursuit for accomplishment of an ideal

* Cynicism is related to success hierarchies

    * when presented a success hierarchy, people may

        * tear down the successful

        * build their own alternative hierarchies - that may not be mapped to reality

        * use envy to fuel inspiration to become better

    * Anytime one admires or envies (? or resents ?), it is a positioning within a success hierarchy

* Approach anxiety / rejection / fear / risk assessment / conflation of risks/issues / experiments over experiences / experience to experiment to learnings to success / idling is failing and worse than rejection as no learning or opportunity for success

## [Maps of Meaning #2](https://discuss.jordanbpeterson.community/t/maps-of-meaning-2/23/1)

Meaning comes from progress towards a goal. *Not achieving the goal. *But the progress towards a certain goal.

Every ideology has a story, and the goal of the stories is to win in the set of all games. Not to win basketball, but to get invited back to play more basketball with your friends.

Peterson's nephew: a knight in a field surrounded by dwarves and a dragon. Every time he cuts a head off of a dragon, a bunch more dwarves appear.

When he runs from the dwarves, they grow into giants as he shrinks. But then he stands on his father's shoulders and uses his sword to stab the dragon’s eyes out.

Then he dives down the dragon's throat. He finds the box of fire and cuts out a section and uses it as a shield.

Conquer your fear, then use it to strengthen yourself. Another example I can think of is Bruce Wayne conquering his fear of bats in Batman Begins.

So what fine goal is worth the suffering of life?** The highest one you can possibly imagine, even if it's just starting with yourself.**

Environmentalist story: savage mankind ruins pristine nature.

Bilbo must become a thief in order to kill the dragon.

Harry Potter breaks the rules all the time in order to beat Voldemort.
